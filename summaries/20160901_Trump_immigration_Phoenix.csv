63,"Donald Trump claims that the core issue in the immigration debate is the well-being of the American people. He argues that Hillary Clinton only focuses on the fears of families being separated, but fails to address the American families who have been permanently separated due to preventable deaths. Trump asserts that while everyone living or residing in the country will be treated with dignity, the greatest compassion should be for American citizens. He accuses President Obama and Hillary Clinton of neglecting their duty by allowing open borders and supporting policies such as Sanctuary Cities, catch-and-release, visa overstays, the release of dangerous criminals, and unconstitutional executive amnesty. This claim was made during a debate on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona on September 1st, 2016."
48,"Donald Trump claims that the media and his opponent only focus on the needs of people living in the country illegally, while ignoring the negative impacts of illegal immigration. He supports his claim by providing examples of crimes committed by illegal immigrants and the financial burden that illegal immigration places on the country. This statement was made during a debate on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona on September 1st, 2016."
43,"Donald Trump claims that there have been multiple victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants due to the Obama-Clinton open borders policies. He specifically mentions the cases of Grant Ronnebeck, a convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona, who was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, and Kate Steinle, who was gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times. Trump also mentions the case of Earl Olander, a 90-year-old man who was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records. Additionally, he brings up the case of Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force Veteran who was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal immigrant who had been arrested multiple times but never deported. Trump supports his claim by referring to a 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office, which found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in prisons and jails had around 25,000 homicide arrests. This claim was made during a debate on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona on September 1st, 2016."
61,"Donald Trump claims that the core issue in the immigration debate is the well-being of the American people.

Trump also criticizes the media elites for thinking that the biggest problem in American society is the 11 million illegal immigrants without legal status. He emphasizes that the well-being of American citizens should be the top priority and that Hillary Clinton only focuses on the concerns of families who came to the country in violation of the law. This claim was made during a debate on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona on September 1st, 2016."

124,"Donald Trump claims that he will suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur. He supports this claim by stating that between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases in the United States. He also argues that the administration refuses to provide Congress with the full information on this matter. Trump plans to ask the Department of State, Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice to review these cases and develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place. He specifically mentions countries like Syria and Libya. Additionally, he proposes new screening tests for all applicants, including an ideological certification to ensure that those admitted share American values. Trump also mentions the need for other countries to take back their people when ordered deported. This claim was made during a debate on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona on September 1st, 2016."
82,"Donald Trump claims that under his administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed from the country. He also states that there are at least 2 million criminal aliens currently inside the country and that they will be moved out in joint operations with local, state, and federal law enforcement. Trump argues that there are additional criminal illegal immigrants who have evaded justice, but their days on the run will soon be over. He further asserts that detainers will be issued for all illegal immigrants arrested for any crime, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings. Trump aims to terminate the Obama Administration's non-enforcement policies that allow criminal aliens to freely roam the streets."
52,"Donald Trump, during a debate on immigration in Phoenix, claimed that the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants, but rather the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers who compete against vulnerable American workers and draw more from the system than they contribute. He argued that the media and his opponent focus solely on the needs of illegal immigrants, while ignoring these facts. Trump stated that anyone who believes the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has spent too much time in Washington."
135,"Donald Trump claims that due to a Supreme Court decision, law enforcement officers have to release violent offenders into U.S. communities if they cannot be sent home. He argues that this has led to terrible consequences, such as the tragic death of Casey Chadwick in Connecticut. Trump further accuses Hillary Clinton of ignoring a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to countries that refuse to take back their criminal citizens. He claims that Clinton's misconduct resulted in the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens. Trump cites a report from the Boston Globe stating that nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities between 2008 and 2014. He blames Clinton for not using her power and duty to stop these releases. Trump also mentions that some of these released individuals went on to reoffend at a high rate, including those convicted of killings and sexual assault. Additionally, Trump promises to complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which Congress has required but has never been completed. He asserts that in his administration, this system will be implemented at all land, air, and sea ports."
