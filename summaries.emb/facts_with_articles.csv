"CLAIM: South Florida Congresswoman Donna Shalala claimed that children housed at the Homestead migrant facility in Florida are treated worse than prisoners, as they only get 30 minutes over a month to talk to family members, while federal prisoners get 300 minutes.

EXPLANATION: Shalala's claim is partially true. While she misspoke about the number of minutes children at the Homestead facility get to speak, which is actually 10 minutes twice a week (80 minutes a month), she is correct that they receive less telephone time than federal prisoners, who get 300 minutes a month. The discrepancy in phone time between the two groups is due to a policy written in 2015 during the Obama administration.",1

"Former Rep. John Delaney claimed during the Democratic debate in Detroit that if every hospital in the country had to be paid at the Medicare rate, they would all close. Delaney's claim is not supported by strong evidence and experts argue that the impact of Medicare for All on hospitals would be more nuanced. While some hospitals may face financial challenges, others may see their revenues increase. Additionally, Delaney oversimplifies the situation by suggesting that hospitals would be paid at the current Medicare rates, when in reality, the government would set a lower price than what private plans currently pay. Overall, Delaney's claim lacks accuracy and evidence, and is rated as false.",1

"During the Democratic debate in Detroit, Bernie Sanders claimed that 30,000 Americans die each year waiting for healthcare due to the cost. This statistic is based on a study called the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, which found a 0.13 percentage point difference in the death rate between those with insurance and those without. However, experts argue that this difference is not statistically significant and cannot be applied broadly. While it is likely that cost barriers prevent many Americans from accessing healthcare, the specific math used to arrive at the 30,000 figure is questionable. Therefore, Sanders' claim is rated as half true.",1

While the numbers in the claim are slightly off, it is mostly true that European countries have moved away from wealth taxes, although not to the extent stated in the op-ed.",1

This claim is mostly true, as immigrants were already being prosecuted for improper entry before 2005, but the Bush administration introduced Operation Streamline in late 2005 to prosecute most immigrants who crossed the border illegally.",1

"On March 4th, 2019, Donald Trump claimed at the Trump CPAC that Democrats voted against a bill to prevent the killing of newborn infants, suggesting that they don't mind executing babies after birth. However, experts on both sides of the abortion policy divide concluded that while Democrats have left themselves open to this line of attack, Trump's claim is inaccurate. Existing laws already make it illegal to harm a newborn infant, and state laws provide primary protection against killing infants born during the process of abortion. The contested issue revolves around the extent of efforts to extend the lives of babies with severe disabilities who are not expected to survive long. Therefore, Trump's claim that Democrats support executing newborns is false.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats includes working towards ending air travel.

EXPLANATION: During a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on March 4th, 2019, Donald Trump made the claim that the Green New Deal includes plans to end air travel. However, fact-checkers have found no evidence to support this claim. The Green New Deal resolution does not mention ending air travel, but rather focuses on overhauling transportation systems, including investment in high-speed rail. The mention of ending air travel comes from a FAQ document released by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's staff, which was later clarified as a mistake. Climate change experts have also stated that ending air travel is not a practical goal and that alternative solutions, such as more efficient planes and low-carbon fuels, are more feasible. Therefore, Trump's claim is false.",1

EXPLANATION: During a rally and in his State of the Union speech, Trump accused Northam of supporting the execution of newborns. However, Northam's comments were taken out of context. In a radio interview, Northam explained that in rare cases of nonviable fetuses, doctors would deliver the baby, keep it comfortable, resuscitate it if desired by the mother, and then have a discussion with the mother. Northam did not clarify what the discussion would entail, leaving room for interpretation. Trump's statement is false as he misstates and exaggerates Northam's words.",1

Trump's statement is partially accurate, as a 2017 report from Doctors Without Borders stated that 31.4 percent of women had been sexually abused during their transit through Mexico. However, it is important to note that the report was based on a survey of more than 400 migrants, the majority of whom were men, and may not be representative of the entire migrant population traveling through Mexico. Therefore, the claim is rated as half true.",1

According to health officials in Tijuana, where the migrants are located, there were three confirmed cases of tuberculosis, four cases of HIV/AIDS, and four separate cases of chickenpox among the 6,000 migrants. The Mexican state of Baja California also clarified that there were no detected cases of tuberculosis. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that 85 percent of immigrants in the U.S. don't show up for their court hearings.

EXPLANATION: During a speech at the Trump CPAC on March 4th, 2019, President Donald Trump made the claim that 85 percent of immigrants in the U.S. do not show up for their court hearings. However, data from the Department of Justice (DOJ) refutes this claim. According to the latest DOJ records, 28 percent of migrants released in the U.S. did not show up for their hearings in the fiscal year that ended on September 30, 2017. For asylees, who are seeking asylum, the non-appearance rate was 11 percent. Even a think tank that argues the DOJ undercounts the non-appearances does not come close to the 85 percent figure.

Immigrants seeking asylum have the legal right to apply for it, but this does not equate to an invitation. While immigrants granted asylum may become eligible for government assistance, this is allowed by law and not a result of Democrats signing them up. Trump's claim is false and distorts the facts.",1

The Veterans Choice program has been in existence since 2014, and a new version of the program was passed by Congress in June 2018. The program was created to provide private care options for veterans who couldn't be given appointments quickly enough or lived far from a VA hospital. The VA Mission Act, signed by Trump, is a major effort to integrate various community care programs, but it won't take effect for at least a year.",1

Trump's claim is misleading and inaccurate. While Gillum has more liberal positions, Nelson does not share those views. Nelson has praised Gillum but does not support his more progressive policies such as raising taxes, government-run healthcare, or abolishing ICE. The claim that Nelson has voted over 300 times to raise taxes is false, as it includes nonbinding budget resolutions and multiple votes on the same legislation. Experts also state that the socialist label does not apply to Nelson, as he does not advocate for a government takeover of businesses. Overall, Trump's claim is deemed to be false.",1

Bush had a higher approval rating among Republicans, as did Dwight Eisenhower and possibly George H.W. Bush.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry disagreed with this claim, stating that NATO members had been increasing their defense spending since 2014. Kerry pointed out that President Barack Obama had successfully secured a pledge from NATO members to increase their defense spending during a meeting in 2014. Kerry's statement is supported by official NATO statistics, which show that European members collectively increased defense spending by 8 percent, or $20 billion, from 2014 to 2017. Additionally, the European share of all NATO member defense spending has been rising since before 2014. Therefore, Kerry's claim is rated as true.",1

EXPLANATION: Trump's claim is not accurate. According to NATO's latest budget report for 2017, the United States contributed about 72 percent of the total defense spending of all NATO members. The claim of 90 percent is not supported by any known source. Additionally, the defense spending of the United States is not solely for NATO, as it includes global defense missions. The burden for defense is different for the United States and European nations, as the U.S. has global defense responsibilities while European allies spend solely for European defense. NATO's common funding is shared among its members based on their GDP, with the U.S. contributing 22 percent. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false.",1

Experts argue that MS13 targets niches or immigrant communities within larger jurisdictions, and there is no evidence to support the claim that entire towns were under the gang's control. Raids by law enforcement may temporarily improve safety, but they do not provide a permanent solution to gang violence. Therefore, Trump's statement is rated as false.",1

"On July 12th, 2018, during the NATO summit, Donald Trump claimed that Wisconsin had not been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, and that Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win. However, election records show that Trump is wrong on both counts. Wisconsin has been won by Republican candidates six times since Eisenhower's win in 1952, and Reagan did not lose Wisconsin in 1984, but rather neighboring Minnesota. This claim by Trump is rated as ""pants on fire"" false by Politifact.",1

"Donald Trump claimed at a rally in Nevada on June 23, 2018, that construction has already started on the border wall in San Diego. However, the projects currently underway in San Diego and Calexico involve replacing existing fencing with bollard-style barriers, which were planned before Trump took office. These projects do not include the solid, 30-foot high concrete wall that Trump promised during his campaign. The $1.6 billion authorized by Congress for these projects does not allow for the construction of any wall prototypes requested by Trump. Therefore, Trump's claim that construction has already started on the border wall is mostly false.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that when undocumented immigrants are released from detention, they never show up for court hearings.

EXPLANATION: During a debate, Donald Trump argued that undocumented immigrants who are released from detention do not show up for their court hearings. While it is true that a significant number of immigrants have been ordered to be deported because they failed to appear in court, in percentage terms, most undocumented immigrants do show up for court. According to Justice Department data, around 60 to 75 percent of nondetained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings. However, it is worth noting that in absolute terms, a significant number of immigrants have had deportation orders filed against them for failure to appear in court.",1

However, it is important to note that the United States has recently run a trade surplus with Canada in dairy products, thanks to the sale of ultrafiltered milk, which is not subject to the high tariffs. Additionally, Trump fails to acknowledge that the United States also imposes trade barriers on certain American-made products.",1

The Trump administration implemented a policy to prosecute all illegal border crossings, which resulted in the separation of families. Previous administrations rarely prosecuted families and instead held them in family detention centers. The decision to prosecute parents is what caused the separations, not a pre-existing law.

The claim about the $150 billion is the highest estimate and lacks evidence to support it. The official amount released after lifted sanctions was estimated to be around $56 billion, and outside analysts believe the number could be lower. However, the claim about the $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate, as the official amount transferred was $1.7 billion. There is no evidence to support the claim about barrels and boxes being involved in the cash transfer. Therefore, this claim is rated as half true.",1

While the unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanics, and women have reached historic lows during Trump's presidency, it is important to note that these trends began before he took office. Economists agree that presidents do not deserve full credit or blame for the unemployment rate, as broader factors and previous administrations also play significant roles.

"On August 21st, 2018, President Donald Trump claimed that there is an unfair trade practice in the automobile trade between the United States and China. He stated that when a car is sent from China to the United States, a tariff of 2.5% is imposed, while when a car is sent from the United States to China, a tariff of 25% is imposed. Trump's figures match up with international trade data, but economists pointed out that his claim lacks context. China makes up a relatively small share of U.S. auto imports, and Trump's own trade policies have contributed to the disparity in car import tariffs. Overall, the claim is rated as mostly true.",1

While there are projects underway to replace existing border fencing and add new barriers, none of these projects include the construction of the border wall prototypes that were ordered by the Trump administration. The $1.6 billion funding allocated for these projects can only be used for the replacement and improvement of existing fences, not for the construction of the promised border wall. The prototypes are still being evaluated and will inform future design standards. Therefore, Trump's claim that the wall has started being built is mostly false.",1

"On July 31st, 2018, during a rally in Tampa, President Donald Trump claimed that the United States lost $500 billion on trade with China in the previous year. However, when examining the numbers, it is clear that Trump's claim is inaccurate. In 2017, the value of Chinese goods imported to the United States exceeded American goods exports to China by roughly $375 billion. When factoring in services trade, the United States actually ran a surplus of approximately $38.5 billion with China. Overall, the trade deficit with China in 2017, considering both goods and services, was around $336 billion, meaning Trump's claim was off by approximately $164 billion. This claim has been rated as mostly false.",1

Additionally, the identities and partisan affiliations of other Justice Department or FBI staff working with the investigation are unknown.

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that Democratic obstruction is the reason why many important positions in government are unfilled.

EXPLANATION: Trump is correct in stating that important government positions are unfilled. However, the blame for this situation is more complex than he suggests. While Democrats do bear some responsibility, Senate Republicans and the Trump White House also contribute to the slow confirmation process. Trump has had the fewest nominees confirmed and the smallest percentage of nominees confirmed by the Senate compared to recent presidents. The Senate confirmation process has become more partisan in recent years, with both Democrats and Republicans engaging in procedural combat. Democrats have forced numerous cloture votes on Trump's nominees, while Republicans have also used holds to delay nominations. Additionally, Trump shares some blame for the unfilled positions due to his slow start in making appointments and poor vetting process. However, Trump has been successful in appointing judges to federal courts. Overall, the claim is rated as half true.",1

The Washington Post reported that Trump later doubled down on his claim on Twitter, stating that the United States does have a trade deficit with Canada, as well as with almost all countries. However, the fact-checking website Politifact found that Trump's statement was mostly false. While the United States does have a trade deficit in goods with Canada, it has a surplus in services, which turns the overall balance of trade into a surplus for the United States. Additionally, Politifact found that the United States actually has a surplus with a majority of countries tracked in official data.",1

While O'Rourke opposes President Trump's border wall and questions the effectiveness of existing fencing, he does not advocate for completely open borders. Additionally, O'Rourke supports a ban on the future sale and possession of certain types of guns, but the legislation he cosponsors does not provide for officials to take any guns held lawfully at the time the measure becomes law.

The Department of Homeland Security reported that in 2017, the government stopped 2,554 individuals on the terrorist watch list from entering the country, which averages to about seven people a day. However, most of these individuals were stopped at airports, not necessarily at the border. Therefore, PolitiFact rated Trump's claim as ""pants on fire,"" meaning it is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.",1

Furthermore, wage growth actually began under President Barack Obama, with wages climbing for the rest of his presidency after hitting a low in the second quarter of 2014.

Additionally, winners of the lottery undergo thorough vetting by the U.S. government before being awarded a visa. Therefore, Trump's statement is rated as ""pants on fire"" by Politifact.",1

This claim was made in reference to former aide Sebastian Gorka's statement that Iran poses a greater threat to America than militant groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS. However, fact-checkers have found no evidence to support the claim that Iran declares war on the US every Friday. While Iranian officials have been known to chant ""Death to America"" during Friday prayers, experts interpret this as rhetoric against American foreign policy rather than a declaration of war. Therefore, Trump's claim is false.",1

CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that Iran has violated the terms of the nuclear deal.
EXPLANATION: During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump accused Iran of violating the terms of the nuclear deal. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the primary authority on monitoring Iran's compliance, has repeatedly found Iran to be in compliance with the agreement. The U.S. State Department also certified Iran's compliance in April 2017. While there have been minor infractions, such as exceeding the limit on heavy water, experts agree that these do not pose a practical risk of Iran developing a nuclear weapon and should not be interpreted as a violation of the deal. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false.",1

The American intelligence community has expressed confidence that Russia interfered in the election to harm Clinton and help Trump. Democrats did not create the story, and they do not control the agenda of the House and Senate committees conducting their own investigations.

However, the stimulus package was not primarily an infrastructure bill, and only a fraction of the total funds were intended for infrastructure. According to the Council of Economic Advisers, about 34% of the expenditures went to public investment, with only about 3% specifically spent on roads and bridges. While the stimulus had its shortcomings, it did build various projects, such as highways, bridges, rail lines, and federal buildings. Therefore, Trump's claim that nothing was built is mostly false.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that Obamacare is in a death spiral during an interview with Trump Robertson.

EXPLANATION: Trump made this claim during an interview, stating that Obamacare is in a death spiral, which refers to a process where healthy people leaving the insurance market causes insurance premiums to rise, leading to more healthy people leaving the market. However, experts have found no evidence of this cycle starting with Obamacare, as federal subsidies are shielding people from feeling the impact of premium increases. The Congressional Budget Office and other independent analyses have also concluded that the healthcare system is stable. Therefore, this claim is false.",1

Economic experts agree that increased trade with China has had a negative impact on American manufacturing, although there is some disagreement on the extent of this impact. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as mostly true.",1

EXPLANATION: During a press briefing on March 21, 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to downplay Manafort's role in the campaign, stating that he played a limited role for a limited amount of time. However, this claim is false. Manafort was initially hired to manage the Republican National Convention and was later promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. He also made media appearances on behalf of Trump and worked closely with Trump's closest advisers. Therefore, Trump's claim that Manafort had a limited role in the campaign is not accurate.",1

However, experts caution that other factors should be considered and it is too early to determine if this decline will continue or if apprehensions will increase in the coming months.

Each country funds its own defense, and Germany does not owe any money to NATO or the United States. The 2 percent of GDP spending target agreed upon by NATO members is for each country's own defense spending, not payments to NATO. Experts have deemed Trump's claim false.",1

This claim was made during a cabinet meeting. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that there was a 40% drop in illegal crossings from January to February 2017. Experts believe that Trump's hardline immigration rhetoric played a role in this decline, but other factors should also be considered. While the decline is significant compared to recent years, it is not unprecedented. It is too early to determine if this decline will continue or if it is solely due to Trump's policies.",1

"CLAIM: During his address to Congress, President Donald Trump claimed that his budget plan includes one of the largest increases in defense spending in the country's history.

EXPLANATION: Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, stated that the White House wants to spend $603 billion on defense, which is nearly a 10 percent increase compared to the spending caps set by a 2011 budget control law. However, when comparing past budgets, it is found that there have been larger increases in military spending. For example, during World War II, defense spending more than doubled. Even in more recent budgets, such as those in the past 35 years, Trump's plan is not exceptional. Additionally, when factoring in the costs of overseas contingency operations, the current defense spending is about $587 billion. Therefore, while Trump's proposed increase is significant, it is not one of the largest in history. Defense analysts have stated that the claim is mostly false.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed in his address to Congress on February 28th, 2017 that Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits, citing a 116 percent increase in Arizona as an example.

EXPLANATION: While it is true that premiums for insurance plans on the federal insurance exchange did increase in the past year, Trump's claim leaves out important details. Premium increases varied across states, with Arizona being the only state where premiums went up by triple digits. Additionally, premiums for employer-based health care, which most people have, did not see the same spikes. Furthermore, more than 70 percent of people who purchase coverage through the exchanges receive subsidies, which offset premium increases for many. Overall, Trump's statement is partially accurate but lacks important context, leading to a rating of ""half true.""",1

He mentioned Sweden alongside other countries that have experienced terrorist attacks and stated that Sweden was having problems due to their immigration policy. However, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim, and Swedish officials and media outlets have denied the occurrence of any such attack. Trump later confirmed on Twitter that he was referring to a Fox News report on Swedish immigration. The fact-check rates Trump's claim as false.",1
"On February 24th, 2017, at the Trump CPAC, Donald Trump claimed that recent immigration sweeps are not business as usual and include people without criminal convictions. He stated that his administration's executive order broadens the definition of ""criminal alien"" and prioritizes the removal of a wide range of individuals, including those convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude, engaged in terrorist activities, and charged with any criminal offense. Trump's claim is accurate, as recent operations have included arrests of individuals who would not have been a high priority for removal under the Obama administration. However, it is important to note that deportations are still primarily focused on individuals who have committed other crimes.",1

While the stock market did reach record highs for five consecutive days, experts say that other factors, such as tax cuts and regulation cuts, also play a role in the stock market's performance. Additionally, consumer confidence decreased in January, although consumers remain confident in the economy's expansion.

Trump drew a distinction between the release of classified information and the release of personal emails, stating that the former is a serious issue while the latter is not. Experts argue that Trump's stance on leaks depends on whether it benefits him, making it a flip-flop.",1

Additionally, experts argue that reversal rates are not a reliable measure of the quality of a court's decisions, especially considering the large number of cases the 9th Circuit handles compared to the few it sends to the Supreme Court.

However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The government has not publicly identified a single example of the Taliban killing someone because they were named in the leaks. While one army witness at Manning's trial claimed that the Taliban killed one person and blamed it on the WikiLeaks revelations, that person's name did not appear in the leaked files, and the military has provided no additional information. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that Obamacare has failed.

EXPLANATION: During a press briefing on January 5, 2017, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan described Obamacare as a failure. Donald Trump echoed this sentiment, stating that Obamacare has failed. However, an analysis of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) shows that it has achieved its major goal of getting more people insured, with an estimated 20 million gaining health insurance as a result of the law. While the ACA did not meet all its promises, such as allowing people to keep their insurance plans if they liked them, it has led to slower growth in healthcare costs. Therefore, Trump's claim that Obamacare has failed is mostly false.",1

However, it was found that one of the men was released before Kenney took office, and the claim that their release poses a direct danger is questionable. Research studies have shown that sanctuary policies, like the one in Philadelphia, actually make communities safer. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false.",1

He supported this claim by stating that floor coverings were used for the first time, which highlighted empty spaces on the National Mall, and that metro ridership was higher compared to Obama's 2013 inauguration. However, these statements were misleading and inaccurate. Floor coverings were also used in 2013, and metro ridership was actually higher for Obama's inauguration. Trump's estimated crowd size of 720,000 was also lower than the 1.8 million who attended Obama's 2009 inauguration. Politifact rated Trump's claim as ""pants on fire.""",1

Ships today are more expensive and powerful than in the past. The United States still maintains the most powerful navy in the world.

While there is some argument that the wealth of typical Chinese workers has increased faster than that of typical Americans, the United States still remains much wealthier.

EXPLANATION: During a press conference, Vice President-elect Mike Pence criticized Obamacare for its impact on Americans' finances, stating that American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000. However, this claim is not entirely accurate. Premiums for Obamacare plans did increase, but the actual dollar increase was $3,612, not $5,000. Additionally, this figure does not take into account the subsidies that most marketplace purchasers qualify for, which actually decreased the out-of-pocket premium cost for qualifying consumers. It is also worth noting that premiums for Obamacare plans rose faster than premiums for employer-sponsored plans. Overall, the claim made by Donald Trump is rated as half true.",1

Additionally, the deal did not prevent the closure of another United Technologies factory in Huntington, Indiana, resulting in the loss of 700 jobs.

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed during a CEO TownHall on April 4th, 2017 that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the stimulus bill, was a trillion-dollar spending bill that was supposed to fix crumbling roads and bridges, but ultimately resulted in having nothing to show for it.

EXPLANATION: Trump's claim is mostly false. While the ARRA was a large spending bill, it was not primarily focused on infrastructure. Only a fraction of the total funds were intended for infrastructure, and even within that category, only a small portion was specifically allocated for roads and bridges. The ARRA also included tax cuts and safety net payments, which had a positive impact on American households. Additionally, the stimulus did fund various infrastructure projects across the country, although its overall impact on job growth and infrastructure needs was relatively modest. Therefore, Trump's claim that there was nothing to show for the stimulus is an exaggeration.",1

He tweeted that he would have won the popular vote if these illegal votes were deducted. However, the latest tally shows that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 2 million votes. Trump also alleged serious voter fraud in Virginia, California, and New Hampshire, three states that voted for Clinton. Election officials in New Hampshire, including the Secretary of State's office, the Attorney General's office, and the U.S. Attorney's office, all stated that they have received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election. Trump's claim was rated as ""pants on fire"" by Politifact NH, as there is no evidence to support it.",1
"On January 26th, 2017, during a flood of tweets about voter fraud, President-elect Donald Trump claimed in a tweet that there was serious voter fraud in three states won by Hillary Clinton during the general election, including California. However, Trump offered no evidence to support this claim, and no one from his office has shown evidence of serious voter fraud in California. Election officials and independent observers in California have stated that there were no widespread reports of voter fraud in the state. California has some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the country, and allegations of fraud are extremely rare. Therefore, Trump's claim about voter fraud in California is deemed to be false and without substantiation.",1
"On January 26th, 2017, Donald Trump claimed on Twitter that he won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is not widespread enough to question millions of votes.

While a recent study found that sanctuary policies have no effect on crime rates, other studies have shown a reduction in crime due to cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Additionally, scholars argue that immigrants, including those in the country illegally, are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Therefore, while Trump's claim is on the right track, it overstates the breadth of research on this topic. The claim is rated as half true.",1

The primary conflict of interest provision in the U.S. code does not apply to the President, and while he will have to comply with financial disclosure requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the application of the emoluments clause in the Constitution.

However, it is misleading to say that all 1.9 million are here illegally. Trump's claim is in the ballpark but misses important details, so it is rated as half true.",1

"On August 22nd, 2017, during a rally in Phoenix, Donald Trump claimed that the New York Times had sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their bad coverage of him. However, this claim is false. The letter from the New York Times primarily thanked readers for their loyalty and promised to provide strong coverage of Trump going forward. While the letter did acknowledge underestimating support for Trump, it did not say their coverage of him was bad and did not include an apology. The New York Times has stated that they are proud of their coverage of the 2016 campaign.",1

The coverage of rally events typically focuses on the candidate speaking behind the podium, but there are numerous examples of news outlets showing the size of Trump's crowds.

While it is true that the FBI had stopped actively investigating Clinton's emails until the latest development, experts say it is unlikely that the investigation was ever formally closed. Additionally, the 650,000 emails were discovered in a separate investigation and it is unclear how many are related to Clinton and how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the FBI. Reports indicate that the bureau is examining only a small portion of the 650,000 emails. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as half true.",1

However, the poverty rates cited by Trump were from 2010, during and after the Great Recession, and have since decreased. The most recent data from 2015 shows that the poverty rate for African-American children under 5 is 37.4%, not nearly as high as Trump suggests. While the poverty levels for African-Americans are still high compared to other racial and ethnic groups, Trump's statistics are outdated and exaggerate the scale of poverty. Therefore, the claim is rated as half true.",1

The Congressional Research Service estimated that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost the United States about 1.6 trillion dollars from 2001 to 2014. However, more comprehensive analyses, such as a study from Brown University, estimate the total cost of the wars to be around 4.79 trillion dollars, including future obligations for veterans' medical and disability costs and interest on borrowing for wars.

This claim was made to challenge the effectiveness of the ACA and highlight the decline in insurers offering policies, which is considered a factor driving the rise in premiums. The data from the Department of Health and Human Services report showed that the number of issuers dropped from 298 in 2016 to 228 in 2017, a decrease of about 23 percent nationally. Therefore, Cruz's claim is supported by official federal data, while Wasserman Schultz's statement is deemed false.",1

However, the study's findings have been highly contested due to issues with the sample size and unreliable database of internet respondents. Experts have refuted the study's findings, and other studies have found minimal cases of noncitizens voting. Therefore, Trump's claim is false.",1

"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Republican nominee Donald Trump claimed that the allegations made by nine women accusing him of groping or kissing them without their consent have been largely debunked. However, an investigation found that while some accounts have been challenged, none have been proven untrue by any objective measure. Some of the women's stories have been questioned, but not one has been conclusively debunked, and the majority of the stories have not been challenged by any evidence other than Trump's denials. Therefore, this claim is false.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump has a habit of claiming the process is rigged when he is losing. She cited examples of Trump tweeting about the Emmys being rigged when his show, ""The Apprentice,"" did not win in 2012, 2013, and 2014. However, while Trump criticized the Emmys and called the system unfair and political, he did not directly accuse the process of being rigged or tampered with. Therefore, Clinton's claim is rated as half true.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton was wrong to say that he mocked a disabled reporter. Trump was referring to an incident at a campaign rally in 2015 where he imitated New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a congenital condition that limits the movement of his joints. Trump denied mocking Kovaleski's disability and insisted that he did not know who the reporter was. However, video evidence and Kovaleski's own account contradicted Trump's claims, leading to the conclusion that Trump did indeed mock the disabled reporter.",1
"During the final debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on October 19th, 2016, Clinton claimed that Trump said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Clinton's claim is accurate, as Trump did state in his immigration speech on August 31st, 2016, that anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. However, Trump also mentioned that after accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, there would be a consideration for the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain, suggesting that not all undocumented immigrants would be deported. Therefore, Clinton's statement is mostly true but requires clarification or additional information.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump used undocumented workers to build his Trump Tower in New York City. She stated that Trump underpaid these workers and threatened to have them deported if they complained. This claim is supported by evidence from media reports and a court case in which Trump was ordered to pay the workers over $325,000. Clinton's statement is rated as true.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton's State Department lost $6 billion, suggesting that the money might have been stolen. However, this claim has been debunked multiple times. The $6 billion figure comes from a misinterpretation of a State Department Inspector General report, which found that paperwork for various contracts had been mismanaged. The money was not missing or stolen, but rather the paperwork documenting the contracts was missing. Therefore, Trump's claim is false, and it has been rated as ""pants on fire"" by fact-checkers.",1
"During the October 19th, 2016 presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton supported his proposal for a massive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He stated that Clinton wanted the wall and fought for it in 2006. Clinton responded by saying she voted for border security, including a wall in limited places, but also other measures like new technology. Trump's claim is partially accurate but taken out of context. While Clinton did vote for a barrier in 2006, it was not to the extent of the concrete wall that Trump supports. Therefore, his statement is rated as half true.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton's tax proposal would raise taxes and even double taxes for Americans. However, independent experts who analyzed the candidates' tax proposals found that the vast majority of taxpayers would either see tax cuts or no change in their tax bill under Clinton's plan. While the richest taxpayers would see increases, even the typical wealthy taxpayer would not see their taxes double. Therefore, Trump's statement was rated as mostly false.",1
"During the final presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that ""we have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election."" This claim was in response to Donald Trump questioning who was responsible for hacking and releasing the emails from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Clinton's claim was rated as true because a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed that the U.S. intelligence community, consisting of 17 agencies, believed that the Russian government directed the cyberattacks.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton wants open borders. He referenced an excerpt from one of her speeches that was leaked in a hacked email. Clinton countered by stating that her remarks about open borders were related to energy and a hemispheric common market. Trump continued to argue that Clinton wants open borders, but fact-checkers have rated this claim as mostly false. While Clinton supports making it easier for some undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, she has repeatedly expressed support for border security. The speech excerpt in question does not provide enough context to fully evaluate Clinton's stance on open borders.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that her opposition to the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia vs. Heller was due to a desire to protect toddlers from firearms. Clinton argued that while she supported an individual's right to bear arms, she disagreed with the court's interpretation of the Second Amendment because it did not accept reasonable regulations on gun ownership. However, the case itself was a challenge to the firearms control regulations act of 1975, which included a broad ban on handguns and other firearms, as well as requirements for firearms to be unloaded, disassembled, or bound by a trigger lock. The city government's petition to the Supreme Court did mention the dangers posed to children, but it also addressed general violent crime trends and other legal arguments. Therefore, Clinton's claim that the case was solely about protecting toddlers from guns is only partially true.",1
"During the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that ""we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."" According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 33,599 gun-related deaths in 2014, and the number has exceeded 33,000 for three consecutive years. However, it is important to note that Clinton's statement includes homicides, suicides, accidental discharges, and legally permissible killings. Suicides account for the majority of gun-related deaths, about two-thirds in recent years. While Clinton's claim is mostly true, it is worth noting the significant proportion of suicides in gun-related deaths.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border. This claim is supported by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which states that nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America. Mexican traffickers have expanded their distribution of heroin into northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin, and the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico has significantly increased in recent years. Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection also provide evidence of the majority of drugs being trafficked across the southwest border from Mexico into the U.S. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as true.",1

He specifically mentioned that Buffett took a ""massive deduction"" and Soros took a ""massive deduction."" However, this claim is mostly false. While both Buffett and Soros had losses, their deductions were not on their personal tax returns. Buffett's deduction was claimed on his business's tax returns, and Soros's losses were from his hedge funds, so any deductions would not appear on his personal tax returns. Trump, on the other hand, claimed a personal deduction for his losses. Without access to their actual tax return forms, it is impossible to determine exactly what each individual did with their taxes.",1

He accused the media of pushing a rigged election against him and questioned why Republican leaders deny what is going on. Trump's claim is baseless and without evidence. Instances of voter fraud, such as voter impersonation and ballot stuffing, are extremely rare and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election. Experts have found very few credible incidents of voter fraud out of billions of votes cast. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as ""pants on fire"" by fact-checkers.",1

"CLAIM: Hillary Clinton claimed during the October 19th, 2016 presidential debate that Donald Trump's tax plan would benefit the wealthy twice as much as the Bush tax cuts.

EXPLANATION: Clinton's claim is supported by analysis from the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Bush tax cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent by 5.3 to 6.7 percent, while the top 1 percent received a tax break equivalent to 0.66 percent of GDP. In comparison, Trump's tax plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy by 10.2 to 19.9 percent and deliver a tax cut equivalent to 1.32 percent of GDP. Therefore, Clinton's claim is rated as true.",1

"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton was involved in a decision as Secretary of State that was laughed at all over the world. He was referring to President Obama's ""red line"" in Syria, where he stated that the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad would change his calculus on armed intervention. Clinton interrupted Trump, denying her involvement, but Trump argued that she was in contact with the White House and that Obama probably still listened to her. Fact-checking reveals that while Clinton was Secretary of State when Obama drew the red line in August 2012, she had been replaced by John Kerry by the time it was confirmed that Assad had crossed the red line in August 2013. However, Clinton was involved in the discussions about how to respond and publicly endorsed the White House's position. Therefore, Trump's claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical information, leading to a mostly false rating.",1
Donald Trump says ICE endorsed him,0
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that there has been an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. This claim is largely accurate, as the number of murders and nonnegligent homicides rose nationally between 2014 and 2015 by 10.8 percent, which is the biggest yeartoyear jump in murders since 1970-71. However, it is important to note that crime rates were heading downward for a quarter-century before this recent increase, and the recent uptick is not significant enough to erase those gains. Criminologists agree that while the increase in murder rates is worth noting, it needs to be understood within a broader context. Therefore, Trump's statement is mostly true but requires clarification and additional information.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 9th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton laughed at a 12-year-old girl who was raped after she helped the accused man. Trump referred to an audio tape where Clinton can be heard laughing, but fact-checkers found that she was actually laughing at the oddities of the case involving the prosecution and the judge, not at the victim. Therefore, Trump's claim was rated as false.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Hillary Clinton criticized Donald Trump for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Clinton argued that Trump's comments were unwise and dangerous, and that they were being used as propaganda by terrorist groups to recruit fighters. She cited examples of videos from al-Shabaab and ISIS that featured Trump's statements about Muslims and called for American Muslims to join the terrorist cause. Clinton's claim was rated as true, although it is difficult to determine the exact impact of Trump's words on recruitment.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that a tweet he sent out about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado was not telling people to ""check out a sex tape,"" but rather to just take a look at her background. However, the tweet he sent at 5:30 a.m. on September 30th did literally say ""check out sex tape."" Fact-checkers rated his statement as ""pants on fire"" because he did direct his followers to check out a sex tape.",1
Trump: Clinton won't use the term 'radical Islamic terrorists',0
"During the presidential debate on October 9th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton wants to move the United States to a single-payer system for healthcare, similar to Canada. He argued that the Canadian healthcare system is slow and catastrophic, and that many Canadians come to the United States for major operations. However, fact-checkers have found that Clinton does not actually support a single-payer system. While she does support a public option for Obamacare, which is a single-payer-like option, she has not called for a complete transition to a single-payer system. Therefore, Trump's claim is false.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 9th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena. The FBI investigation found that Clinton's staff received a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails on March 4th, 2015, and an employee managing her server deleted the emails three weeks later. However, the FBI also found no evidence that the emails were intentionally deleted to avoid the subpoena. Clinton's team had requested the deletion of the emails months before the subpoena was issued, and they argued that all relevant emails had already been turned over to the State Department. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as half true by Politifact.",1
"During the second presidential debate in St. Louis, Hillary Clinton claimed that the United States currently has the highest health insurance coverage in its history, with 90% of Americans covered. This claim was supported by data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which reported that 90.9% of Americans had some form of health coverage in 2015, the highest percentage recorded. The uninsured rate had also declined from 16.3% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015. Therefore, Clinton's statement was rated as true.",1

"During a campaign stop in Florida, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton promised to create 200,000 jobs for upstate New York during her 2000 Senate campaign, but not only did she fail to deliver on that promise, but the region also lost many jobs. The Washington Post analyzed Clinton's pledge and concluded that while her efforts fell flat, the area did not actually lose jobs. However, when looking at just private-sector jobs and using different definitions of upstate New York, it is true that Clinton did not meet her jobs target and the region did lose jobs. Overall, Trump's claim is mostly true.",1

Mike Pence responded by saying, ""Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again."" Kaine continued to press the issue, and Pence defended Trump by saying that he also said ""many of them [Mexicans] are good people."" While Pence is correct that Kaine left out that part of the quote, it is important to note that Trump actually said ""some"" rather than ""many"" and added ""I assume"" which undermines the sentiment. The claim is partially accurate but lacks important context, so it is rated as half true.",1

Kaine argued that this demonstrated a pattern of bias in law enforcement. Multiple independent press reports, including one commissioned by the state legislature, confirmed that Castile had been stopped by police at least 46 times, supporting Kaine's claim.",1
"CLAIM: During the October 19th, 2016 presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump has said that more countries should have nuclear weapons.

EXPLANATION: Clinton's claim is based on various statements made by Trump in interviews and debates. Trump has suggested that countries like Japan and South Korea might be better off if they had nuclear weapons to defend themselves against threats like North Korea. However, he has also stated that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general. Therefore, Clinton's claim is rated as mostly false.",1
"During the October 4th vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence claimed that if Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are elected, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) will be expanded into a single-payer program. However, this claim is mostly false. While Clinton does support a public option for Obamacare, which is a government-sponsored insurance plan, she has consistently resisted the suggestion of a single-payer system and has stated that she would work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and improve upon it.",1
"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Tim Kaine claimed that Republicans, including Donald Trump, want to privatize Social Security. Kaine referenced Trump's book from 2000 where he called Social Security a Ponzi scheme and proposed allowing Americans to invest their payroll taxes in personal accounts. However, Kaine's claim is not entirely accurate as Trump has since stated his support for keeping Social Security as is without significant changes like private accounts. Therefore, Kaine's claim is mostly false.",1
"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Tim Kaine claimed that Richard Nixon released his tax returns when he was under audit. This claim was in response to Mike Pence's statement that Donald Trump would release his tax returns once his audit was concluded. Kaine argued that Nixon's actions set a precedent for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Fact-checkers found Kaine's claim to be true, as Nixon did release his tax returns while under audit in December 1973.",1
Kaine: Trump said undocumented immigrants 'will all be gone',0
"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Republican Mike Pence claimed that only 10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes. However, this claim is false. While it is true that the foundation gives a small fraction of its resources in grants, about 87 percent of its expenses go towards services it provides directly. The Clinton Foundation operates like a public charity and has been rated highly by experts in the field.",1
"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Tim Kaine claimed that during President Barack Obama's tenure, the United States has created 15 million new jobs. This claim is partially true, as Kaine cherry-picked the time frame by starting the count at the low point in the job market, which was just over a year after Obama took office. If the count starts at the beginning of Obama's presidency, the number of jobs increased by 10.9 million, which is about two-thirds of the 15 million figure Kaine touted. Additionally, it is important to note that no elected official deserves full credit or blame for economic results, as other factors beyond their control also play a role.",1
"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Mike Pence claimed that Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement. However, this claim is mostly false. While negotiations did fail, the key decisions and discussions took place between the White House and Iraqi leaders, not solely Clinton. The Obama administration wanted to protect American troops from legal action in Iraq, which was a sensitive issue in the Iraqi parliament. There is no evidence to suggest that the administration simply walked away from a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq. Therefore, the claim lacks key information and is misleading.",1
Mike Pence leaves out some details on his tax cu,0
"During the 2016 vice presidential debate on October 5th, Republican Mike Pence claimed that Democrat Tim Kaine tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion during his time as Virginia governor from 2006 to 2010. Pence was referring to three unsuccessful tax proposals made by Kaine, including a plan to raise taxes for transportation and a proposal to raise state income tax rates. However, it should be noted that Kaine's 2009 income tax hike was offset by a $650 million cut in the state's car tax. Therefore, the net annual cost of all three tax and fee proposals was $3.35 billion. Pence's claim is mostly true, but his math double counts Kaine's unsuccessful efforts to raise taxes for transportation.",1
"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Senator Tim Kaine claimed that both Donald Trump and Governor Mike Pence want to eliminate the federal minimum wage. While it is true that Trump has made conflicting statements about wages and the minimum wage, he has never explicitly called for its elimination. Pence, on the other hand, has a record of opposing minimum wage increases but has not called for its elimination either. Therefore, Kaine's claim is rated as half true.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia.

EXPLANATION: In a campaign rally in 2016, Trump made this claim, which he reiterated in a press conference in 2017. The claim refers to a deal involving the Russian nuclear agency and a Toronto-based company called Uranium One. The deal allowed Russia to acquire a controlling stake in Uranium One, which owns mines, mills, and land in the United States, accounting for about 20 percent of the country's uranium production capacity. However, it is important to note that the 20 percent refers to capacity, not uranium that has been produced. The deal was approved by a committee composed of representatives from various U.S. government agencies, including the State Department, where Clinton was Secretary of State at the time. However, Clinton did not have the power to unilaterally approve or reject the deal, as it required the approval of multiple agencies and ultimately President Obama. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false.",1

"During the first presidential debate on September 26th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Clinton insiders, Patti Solis Doyle and Sidney Blumenthal, pushed the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in America. Trump pointed to an interview with Doyle on CNN where she mentioned a volunteer coordinator forwarding an email promoting the birther rumor. However, Doyle later clarified that she was referring to an email about Obama's religion, not his birthplace. As for Blumenthal, while he did contact a reporter at McClatchy to explore rumors about Obama's birthplace, there is no solid evidence that he questioned Obama's birthplace. Therefore, the claim made by Trump is false.",1
"On September 26th, 2016, during the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump has not paid any federal income tax. She suggested that Trump may be reluctant to release his tax returns because he doesn't want the American people to know that he hasn't paid taxes. However, this claim is mostly false. While the tax returns in question have not been released, a 1981 report from New Jersey gambling regulators shows that Trump did pay federal taxes for three out of five years, as verified by the Division of Gaming Enforcement. In the final two years, he did not pay federal income taxes due to significant losses in his business operations. Therefore, Clinton's statement ignores critical facts and is misleading.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump was sued by the Justice Department in 1973 for racial discrimination because he refused to rent apartments to African-Americans. This claim is true. Trump, along with his father and their company, Trump Management, was sued under the Civil Rights Act for violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against tenants based on their race. The case was settled, and while Trump never admitted guilt, his company had to agree to measures to prevent future discrimination.",1
"During the first presidential debate on September 26th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump's tax plan would increase the national debt by over $5 trillion and raise taxes for some middle-class Americans. Independent experts, including Lily L. Batchelder, a professor at New York University Law School, confirmed that Clinton's statement accurately summarized their findings. Batchelder's analysis, along with the Tax Foundation and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, supported Clinton's claim that Trump's plan would significantly increase the debt and disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy. Additionally, Batchelder's research showed that Trump's plan would raise taxes for approximately 7.8 million families with minor children. The Tax Foundation also acknowledged that while taxpayers in all income groups would see more money, wealthier Americans would benefit more from Trump's plan. Overall, Clinton's statement was rated as true.",1
"During the first presidential debate on September 26th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that there have been thousands of shootings in Chicago since January 1st. This claim was made in response to a question about how the candidates would address the racial divide in the country. Trump's campaign provided an article from Forbes that stated in 2015, 2,988 people were shot in Chicago, and as of September 8th, 2016, there had already been 2,949 shootings. The Chicago Tribune also confirmed these numbers, reporting that from January 1st to September 26th, 2016, there were 3,210 shooting victims. The Chicago Police Department data showed that there were 2,521 shooting incidents up to September 18th, 2016. While these numbers represent shootings and not necessarily homicides, experts confirmed that there has been an increase in gun violence in Chicago in recent years. However, they also noted that violent crime in Chicago is much lower than it was 20 years ago and that Chicago is not representative of crime in the entire United States. Therefore, Trump's claim that there have been thousands of shootings in Chicago is true.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that he did not support the war in Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. However, the record does not support his assertion. Trump's comments around the time of the invasion were vague and he did not voice full-throated opposition until almost a year and a half after the invasion. Therefore, this claim is false.",1
"On January 11th, 2017, during a press conference, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton was wrong in saying that he publicly invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to hack into American emails. Trump referred to a press conference he held on July 27th, 2016, where he said, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing."" However, Trump's campaign later stated that he was being sarcastic in his remarks. Fact-checkers rated Clinton's claim as half true, as Trump's statement referred specifically to Clinton's emails, not all American emails.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) the ""gold standard"" of trade deals. This claim was made in response to Clinton's defense that she had only supported the deal before it was finalized. Trump's claim is supported by Clinton's remarks in 2012, where she referred to the TPP as setting the ""gold standard"" in trade agreements. However, it is worth noting that Clinton later changed her position and opposed the deal after it was finalized. Therefore, Trump's statement is rated as mostly true.",1
"During the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on September 26th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that gun violence is the leading cause of death for young African American men, more than the next nine causes combined. This claim is accurate according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2014, there were 2,256 gun-related homicides compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined for African American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24. When accidents and suicides related to guns are included, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths widens even further. However, it should be noted that this statement is dependent on the chosen age range and is not correct for African American boys between the ages of 10 and 14. Overall, Clinton's statement is accurate when defining ""young"" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, according to CDC data.",1
"During the first presidential debate on September 26th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that his 92-page financial disclosure form provides a better understanding of his finances than his tax returns would. He argued that going to the Federal Elections Commission to see his financial disclosure form would reveal more about him than looking at his tax returns. However, experts disagree with this claim, stating that tax returns would provide valuable information about his effective tax rate, types of taxes paid, charitable giving, and a more detailed picture of his income-producing assets. Therefore, Trump's statement was deemed false.",1
"During a debate on September 26th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Trump interrupted and denied ever saying that. However, it was found that Trump did tweet in 2012 that the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese. Trump has also called climate change a hoax in speeches, tweets, and media appearances. While he has described his remark as a joke, there is still some truth to Clinton's claim. Therefore, his statement is rated as mostly false.",1
"During the first presidential debate on September 26th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump had suggested negotiating down the national debt of the United States. Clinton's claim is supported by two separate interviews in May 2016, where Trump discussed the possibility of renegotiating and buying back debt at a discount. However, Trump later backtracked on his statements after facing criticism. Experts have stated that negotiating down the national debt would have severe consequences and is unlikely to be feasible. Overall, Clinton's claim is rated as mostly true.",1
"On September 26th, 2016, during the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. She cited examples from 2006 to 2009 when Trump spoke optimistically about the opportunities created by falling real estate prices. While Trump did not welcome the tragedy of foreclosures, he did speak positively about the opportunities for investors like himself. Clinton's claim is mostly true, as it matches Trump's words, although it leaves out some nuance.",1

Over the past half-century, African-Americans have made significant progress in areas such as life expectancy, educational attainment, and employment rates. While disparities still exist, the current situation is far from the worst it has ever been. The statement is rated as ""pants on fire"" false.",1

"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed in a television ad that Democrats and Republicans working together were able to get Russia to cut their nuclear arms. She specifically mentioned the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) as the agreement between Russia and the United States that limited both countries' deployed strategic nuclear weapons. However, experts argue that Clinton's claim is imprecise and overstates the impact of the treaty. While New START does place tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons than previous treaties, Russia was already meeting most of the treaty's limits when it went into effect in 2011. Additionally, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons or require the destruction of existing weapons. Therefore, the claim is rated as half true.",1

Kaine argued that Trump continued to promote birtherism even after President Obama released his long-form birth certificate in 2011. Kaine supported his claim by citing Trump's tweets from 2011 to 2014, in which Trump either advocated for birtherism or expressed skepticism about Obama's birthplace. Kaine also pointed out that polls conducted after the release of Obama's birth certificate showed that a significant number of Americans still believed that Obama was born outside the United States. Therefore, Kaine concluded that Trump's claim of finishing the birther controversy was false.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton started the rumors questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States. He referred to a press conference he held on September 16th, 2016, where he stated that Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. However, fact-checkers have debunked this claim multiple times, as there is no evidence to support it. While Clinton supporters circulated the allegations during the 2008 Democratic primary, there is no record of Clinton or her campaign promoting the birther theory. Therefore, Trump's claim is false.",1

Kaine stated that when Gadhafi was set to visit the United Nations and no one would let him stay in New York, Trump allowed him to set up the tent. This claim was rated as true, as it was confirmed that Gadhafi rented space at Trump's estate to put up his tent. Trump himself acknowledged this, although he framed it as a boast about how he snookered Gadhafi out of a lot of money.",1

This claim was verified by reporter David Fahrenthold of The Washington Post, who found that the Trump Foundation had received most of its funds from sources other than Trump himself. Fahrenthold also confirmed the anecdote about the painting with the artist who created it. Therefore, Clinton's claim was rated as true.",1

He argued that heroin, which has seen a significant increase in overdoses, is entering the United States largely through the southern border. This claim is supported by data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the White House, which all confirm that the majority of heroin in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.

"On September 26th, 2016, during the first presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that Barack Obama had doubled the national debt during his time in office. Trump justified his statement by referring to figures from the U.S. Treasury Department, which showed that the national debt was $10.6 trillion when Obama took office in 2009 and had risen to $19.5 trillion by September 6th, 2016. Trump's estimate that the debt would be close to $20 trillion by the end of Obama's term is reasonable. However, it is important to note that the rise in the debt was not solely Obama's responsibility, as Congress had to approve the spending bills. Additionally, the recession that began before Obama took office also contributed to the increase in debt. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as half true.",1

He made this claim at various events, including a rally honoring prisoners of war and troops missing in action, a speech outlining his immigration plan, and a speech at the Union League of Philadelphia. The Trump campaign argued that politicians, including Hillary Clinton, give more attention and support to those in the country illegally than to veterans. However, fact-checkers found that veterans have access to education, healthcare, and tax benefits that undocumented immigrants do not have. Therefore, the claim made by Trump is false.",1

"During a debate on September 26th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump extensively supported the attacks that toppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. She argued that there was no difference between herself and Trump on the Libyan action. Clinton supported her claim by referencing a video from Trump's own video blog in which he stated, ""We should go in, we should stop this guy."" Although there were not many comments from Trump about Libya, the few that were found showed his support for intervention. Therefore, Clinton's claim was rated mostly true.",1
"During the NBC commander in chief forum on September 7th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that none of the emails she sent or received had a header indicating that they were classified. While it is true that none of her emails had a header, it is important to note that the absence of a header does not mean that the information was not classified. The FBI found 81 email chains on Clinton's private server that contained classified information, although they were not properly labeled. Therefore, Clinton's claim is mostly true, but it needs additional context to fully understand the situation.",1
"During the NBC commander in chief forum on September 7th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that her opponent, Donald Trump, supports privatizing the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. She stated that she would not let the VA be privatized and that she believed there was an agenda to do so supported by Trump. However, fact-checkers found that Trump does not support privatizing the system but rather allowing veterans to have access to private providers when facing delays at the VA. While Clinton's statement contains some truth, it ignores critical facts and is therefore rated as mostly false.",1
"During the NBC commander-in-chief forum on September 7th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton said the veterans affairs scandal is overexaggerated and that she was satisfied with what was going on. However, this claim is misleading and leaves out important context. While Clinton did say that the problems at the VA have not been as widespread as portrayed, she also acknowledged systemic issues and repeatedly called for reform to ensure veterans receive timely care. Therefore, Trump's statement is rated as mostly false.",1
"CLAIM: During the 3rd presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump initially supported the war in Iraq.

EXPLANATION: In response to a question about her own vote in favor of the Iraq war, Clinton pointed out that Trump had initially supported the war. Trump denied this claim during the debate, stating that he was ""totally against the war in Iraq."" However, evidence from interviews and statements made by Trump before the invasion of Iraq contradicts his claim of being against the war. Trump's statements at the time indicated some level of acceptance or support for military action, even if he later criticized the handling of the war. Therefore, Clinton's claim that Trump initially supported the war in Iraq is deemed false.",1

While grantmaking is not part of its mission, the foundation spends a significant amount of money on its own in-house programs, which accounted for about 80 percent of its expenses in 2013. Therefore, Castellanos' claim is rated as mostly false.",1

"During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Donald Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, claimed that Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to the United States by 550 percent. This claim is accurate, as Clinton had previously supported allowing in 65,000 refugees, while Obama supported a figure of 10,000. However, it is important to note that these numbers applied to fiscal year 2016 and Clinton has not discussed numbers for the next fiscal year. Additionally, there is a screening process for refugees, with the UN identifying and screening them before they are referred to a country for resettlement. U.S. security agencies also conduct multiple security checks. Therefore, Pence's claim is deemed true.",1

"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Mike Pence claimed that Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and that her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget. However, Clinton has not pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, but rather promised to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship. While Clinton does support allowing certain immigrants to stay in the US and be temporarily free from deportation, this does not constitute amnesty. Additionally, Clinton's plan does not provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare to immigrants, as they would have to pay into the system like everyone else. It would take at least a decade, if not longer, for them to be eligible for Social Security and Medicare benefits. Furthermore, even if all 11 million undocumented immigrants were eligible for Medicaid, it would not break the federal budget. Therefore, Pence's statement is mostly false.",1
"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that since 2013, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities.

EXPLANATION: Trump's claim is based on an estimate provided by Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies with the Center for Immigration Studies. The estimate includes three categories: 86,288 criminal aliens released from custody pending removal proceedings, 18,646 requests by ICE to hold deportable aliens denied by state and local law enforcement agencies, and over 200,000 criminal aliens let off by ICE officers due to prosecutorial discretion. However, experts have raised concerns about the accuracy of the 200,000 figure, as it relies heavily on Vaughan's calculations of ICE data, which can be opaque and hard to obtain. Additionally, there is a dispute over the definition of ""criminal aliens"" and whether the Obama administration's prioritization of removal proceedings is driven by political considerations or resource constraints. Overall, the claim is rated as half true.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that at least 23 countries refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals.

EXPLANATION: Trump's claim is accurate, as the figure of 23 countries comes from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement document. These countries, such as Afghanistan, Algeria, China, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Zimbabwe, are considered recalcitrant in taking back their citizens. However, the claim about large numbers of violent criminals is harder to verify, as the data shows that traffic or drug-related offenses are more common among illegal immigrants. While there were some convictions for violent offenses, they make up a smaller percentage overall. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly true.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States could be as low as 3 million or as high as 30 million.

EXPLANATION: Trump has questioned the commonly cited estimate of 11 million undocumented immigrants in the past, and in his recent speech on immigration, he reiterated his doubts about this number. However, experts from various organizations that study immigration have stated that Trump's claim is inaccurate. The Department of Homeland Security estimated the undocumented immigrant population at 11.4 million in 2012, and other independent organizations have provided similar figures. These estimates are based on subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census. Experts argue that there is no evidence to support Trump's claim of 3 million or 30 million undocumented immigrants, and they consider these figures to be virtually impossible. The experts also explain that the 11 million estimate has remained consistent because of the continuous flow of undocumented immigrants entering and leaving the country. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as ""pants on fire"" false.",1
"Donald Trump claimed in a speech in Arizona that illegal immigration costs the United States more than $113 billion a year. He cited a 2013 report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) as the source of this data. However, the report's estimates are based on broad assumptions and have been criticized for their lack of accuracy. Other reports from pro-immigration or neutral groups have estimated the costs to be significantly lower. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as mostly false.",1

However, it is important to note that the survey is not scientific and is based on anecdotal reports. Experts in bullying agree that the survey and their own observations support Clinton's claim.",1

While only a small portion of the donations are awarded as grants, the Clinton Foundation actually spends between 80-90 percent on program services, which is the standard in the industry for defining charitable work. The majority of the money is spent directly on projects rather than through third-party grants. Therefore, Pence's claim is false.",1

Iran had a legitimate claim to the money as part of a longstanding financial dispute, and the payment was used as leverage to ensure the release of the prisoners.

While her proposed investment is larger than any other 10-year investment since World War II, when considering the size of historical public investments as a share of GDP, there have been 12 years with larger public investments. Additionally, it is uncertain whether these investments will result in new, good-paying jobs as it depends on predictions and the effectiveness of the proposed programs.

He supported this claim by citing a list of tax hikes enacted under Obama, including levies on tobacco products and taxes to fund healthcare reforms. However, experts have pointed out that there haven't been many major tax changes during Obama's term, and the tax burden on households has actually remained relatively stable. While Obama did raise some taxes, he also extended tax cuts and enacted temporary tax cuts to stimulate the economy. Therefore, Pence's claim is rated as half true.",1
"During a campaign speech in Youngstown, Ohio on September 26th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that NATO had changed their policy and created a new division focused on terror threats in response to his previous comments that NATO was obsolete. However, experts have found very little accuracy in this statement. While NATO did create a new division for coordinating intelligence sharing, this change was not significant and had been in the works before Trump's comments. Furthermore, NATO has been involved in counterterrorism efforts since 1980 and invoked Article 5 after the 9/11 attacks. Experts also noted that NATO's structure and role have made it an imperfect vehicle for counterterrorism. Overall, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that NATO changed their policy in response to his comments, and experts believe that the change was not influenced by him. Therefore, Trump's statement is false.",1

"On January 11th, 2017, during a press conference, Donald Trump claimed that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founder and co-founder of ISIS, respectively. He repeated this claim multiple times in various speeches and interviews. However, experts have stated that this claim is wildly inaccurate.

However, it is important to note that the debt cannot solely be attributed to Obama, as Congress also plays a role in approving spending.

In 2015, he stated that he got to know Putin well due to their joint appearance on 60 Minutes.

"On February 5th, 2017, during an interview with Bill O'Reilly, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton's Iran nuclear deal ""lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money."" However, this claim is mostly false. While Iran is indeed labeled as the top state sponsor of terrorism by the United States, the nuclear deal was struck 2.5 years after Clinton left the Obama administration. Additionally, the majority of the money that Iran received was its own assets that were frozen due to sanctions, not American money.

Trump has sought H-2B visas for low-skilled, low-wage workers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Critics argue that these visas allow employers to exploit foreign workers, while employers argue that they need these workers to fill jobs that Americans don't want.

"During his nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21st, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, who had been ordered deported, were roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. This claim was based on a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, which relied on data obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The report stated that as of July 2015, there were over 925,000 immigrants who had been ordered removed but were still in the country, and an estimated 20% of them had at least one criminal conviction. While Trump's numbers are accurate, experts point out that there is important context to consider. Some of these immigrants come from countries that refuse to accept them back, so they have to be released after completing their sentences. Additionally, some state and local jurisdictions have policies that limit cooperation with immigration authorities, so they do not notify them when a deportable noncitizen has completed a jail term or prison sentence. Immigration officials also make custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, and those who do not pose a threat to the community may be placed on some form of supervision as an alternative to detention. Overall, Trump's statement is accurate but needs additional information, so it is rated as mostly true.",1
"In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21st, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that an amendment pushed by Lyndon Johnson threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. This claim is true. The restriction is actually a law, not an amendment, and it applies to all nonprofit charitable organizations, not just religious institutions. The law prohibits these organizations from directly or indirectly participating in or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for elective public office. Violating this restriction could result in the revocation of the organization's tax-exempt status and the imposition of taxes. However, nonpartisan, unbiased voter education activities are allowed. Trump's statement is accurate, although it is important to note that the prohibition applies to all nonprofit organizations, not just religious institutions.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that the United States is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. While he slightly tempered his language from previous statements, this claim is still mostly false. Trump did not specify that he was referring to the corporate tax rate, which is higher than most industrialized nations. However, when considering overall tax burden, the United States is not one of the highest-taxed nations. Therefore, the claim is misleading and lacks accuracy.",1
"On July 21st, 2016, during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump claimed that household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. This claim is accurate, as median household income fell from $57,724 in 2000 to $53,657 in 2014, adjusted for inflation. However, it is worth noting that the majority of this decline occurred during the presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican. Since Obama took office, household incomes have fallen by $1,656. Therefore, while Trump's statement is true, it needs additional context, so it is rated as mostly true.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that the United States had a trade deficit in goods of nearly $800 billion in the previous year. According to census data, the trade deficit in goods for 2015 was $763 billion, which is reasonably close to Trump's claim. Therefore, the fact-checkers rated Trump's claim as true.",1
"Donald Trump's largely accurate about Clinton's past support for NAFTA, T",0
"On July 21st, 2016, during the Trump draft RNC, Donald Trump claimed that his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment. However, there is no evidence that Clinton has ever explicitly stated or suggested that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. While she has called for stronger gun control measures, she has consistently affirmed her support for the right to bear arms. Some gun rights advocates argue that Clinton's comments on gun control imply a desire to roll back the Second Amendment, but this is a matter of interpretation. Overall, Trump's claim is false.",1
"During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21st, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton plans a ""massive"" tax increase, while he has proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate running for president. The claim is mostly true. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center estimates that Clinton's proposed tax hikes would primarily affect the highest earners, with the top 5 percent of taxpayers experiencing an average reduction of less than 1 percent in after-tax income. On the other hand, Trump's tax cuts would be the largest of any candidate, with the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent being 17.5 percent of after-tax income. However, economists are skeptical about the sustainability of Trump's tax cuts, as they would require significant cuts to federal spending or an increase in debt.",1
"On July 21st, 2016, during the Trump draft RNC, Donald Trump claimed that America has lost nearly one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 due to disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump specifically blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and China's entry into the World Trade Organization for the loss of jobs. While the numbers are accurate, the impact of the trade deals on manufacturing jobs is more complex. While NAFTA likely had little impact on jobs, there is broad agreement that China's entry into the WTO resulted in the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. However, economists do not attribute the entire number of jobs lost to either trade deal. Additionally, Trump's claim that the trade deals and their alleged failures are solely the fault of the Clintons overlooks the role played by Republicans in supporting these deals. Overall, the claim is rated as half true.",1
"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Mike Pence claimed that Hillary Clinton supports sanctuary cities. He referenced a statement made by Donald Trump at the Republican convention, where Trump criticized Clinton for favoring shielding undocumented immigrants from federal laws. Pence argued that sanctuary cities, which limit their assistance to federal immigration officials, harm the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws and give some undocumented immigrants a pass. He also mentioned a case in San Francisco where a man who had been deported multiple times was released from jail and later charged with murder. Pence's claim was rated mostly true by Politifact.",1
"On July 21st, 2016, during his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton has called for a ""radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees"" and that there is no way to screen these refugees to find out who they are or where they come from. The fact-checking analysis states that the 550 percent figure is correct, but it is incorrect to suggest that there is no screening process for Syrian refugees. The refugees undergo an extensive screening process that includes referrals, interviews, background checks, medical screenings, and security clearances, which can take up to two years or longer. The claim is rated as half true.",1
"In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination on July 21st, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that 43 million Americans are on food stamps. This claim was fact-checked and found to be true. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that in April 2016, there were almost 43.6 million people receiving SNAP benefits, the lowest level since October 2010. However, it is important to note that the number of participants has been decreasing in recent years due to the economic recovery.",1
"On July 21st, 2016, during his speech accepting the Republican party nomination for president, Donald Trump claimed that the number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far in that year already exceeded the entire total from 2015. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) statistics, if interpreted by fiscal year (October 1 to September 30), Trump's claim is correct. However, if interpreted by calendar year (January 1 to December 31), his claim is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is rated as half true.",1
"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that ISIS was not an issue before Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State.

SUMMARY: During the Republican National Convention on July 21st, 2016, Donald Trump stated that ISIS was not a problem before Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. However, experts have pointed out that ISIS existed under a different name before Clinton's time, and there were various factors that contributed to its rise, including the intervention in Libya and the Iraq invasion.

EXPLANATION: Donald Trump made the claim during the Republican National Convention that ISIS was not a concern before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. However, experts have refuted this claim, stating that ISIS existed under a different name before Clinton's tenure. They also pointed out that there were multiple factors that contributed to the rise of ISIS, including the intervention in Libya and the Iraq invasion, both of which Clinton had some involvement in. Therefore, the claim made by Trump is considered mostly false.",1
"On July 21st, 2016, during his speech accepting the Republican nomination, Donald Trump claimed that homicides in America's 50 largest cities increased by 17% last year, which he stated was the largest increase in 25 years. This claim was based on calculations made by The Washington Post. However, Trump ignored the cautionary notes in the same article, which stated that there was no single explanation for the increases and no clear pattern among the cities that experienced the most violence. The article also noted that other data showed a more modest increase in violent offenses nationally. Criminologists cautioned against making too much of changes in data over a single year and emphasized the importance of looking at long-term trends, which show that violent crime has been consistently falling for about a quarter century. Therefore, Trump's claim was rated as half true.",1
"In his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president at the party's national convention in Cleveland on July 21st, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that ""two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office less than eight years ago."" While it is true that there has been an increase of about 2 million Hispanic people living in poverty since 2008, this statistic is misleading because the Hispanic population has also grown during this time. The poverty rate among Hispanics has remained relatively stable throughout Obama's presidency, hovering just above 23 percent. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as half true.",1

However, Clinton has supported legislation in 2013 that included a path to citizenship with conditions and heightened border security. While Clinton's plan would make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation, it does not mean open borders or ending enforcement.

The VA's research, based on records from every state, found that in 2014, 7,403 veterans took their own lives, averaging about 20 veterans a day. The research also showed that 65% of veterans who committed suicide in 2014 were 50 or older, aligning with Trump's statement about older veterans being particularly affected. The VA concluded that veterans have a 21% higher risk of suicide than non-serving adults.",1

"During a rally in Phoenix on June 18th, 2016, Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of receiving tens of millions of dollars from countries that mistreat women and kill gay people. He specifically referenced donations given to the Clinton Foundation. While it is true that the Clinton Foundation has received donations from countries with poor records on human rights, it is important to note that political candidates cannot accept money from foreign governments. Therefore, Trump's claim that Clinton personally received money from these countries is an oversimplification. However, the claim is rated as half true because the Clinton Foundation did receive donations from these countries both before and after Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.",1

This claim is accurate, as Trump received about 13.3 million votes, surpassing George W. Bush's previous record of 11.5 million votes. However, it is worth noting that Trump also holds the record for the most votes cast against a primary candidate, and he was supported by less than half of the Republican Party's primary voters. Therefore, while Trump's claim is accurate, it lacks important context, and is rated as mostly true.",1

However, this claim is mostly false. While the State Department did approve Russia's gradual takeover of a company with U.S. uranium assets, it was not a unilateral decision and required approval from multiple government agencies. Additionally, most of the donations to the Clinton Foundation occurred before the Russian deal, and there is no evidence of a quid pro quo.

"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Mike Pence claimed that Hillary Clinton's immigration platform would create ""totally open borders"" for the United States. However, this claim is false. Clinton has supported legislation that includes a path to citizenship with conditions and heightened border security. While she does want to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, this does not mean she wants to end all enforcement or create open borders. Clinton's plan calls for protecting the border and targeting deportation to criminals and security threats. Therefore, Pence's claim is a distortion of Clinton's proposals.",1
"During a speech on June 22nd, 2016, Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of trying to delete her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. He claimed that she had deleted the record of her support from her book.

In her book, ""Hard Choices,"" Clinton discussed the importance of the TPP and its potential benefits for American workers. While a small reference to the TPP was removed in the paperback edition of the book, the pages discussing its importance were not deleted. Therefore, Trump's claim that Clinton deleted her support for the TPP from her book is false.",1

However, the Trump campaign did not provide any supporting numbers for this claim. The Obama administration's budget request for FY 2017 is about $2.2 billion for refugees, and even if Clinton were to double or triple that amount, it would still be nowhere near the hundreds of billions Trump claimed. Additionally, the estimated cost to rebuild America's inner cities is over $225 billion, making Trump's numbers significantly off. This claim is rated as ""pants on fire.""",1

Trump's harshest criticism of the war came more than a year into the conflict. Therefore, Trump's claim is false.",1

"CLAIM: During the October 19th, 2016 presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that 9 million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine thanks to the efforts of the Clinton Foundation and her husband.

EXPLANATION: The Clinton Foundation, specifically the Clinton Health Access Initiative, has been working since 2002 to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment through bulk-buying and negotiating with drug companies. The World Health Organization has recognized the Clinton Health Access Initiative as one of the organizations collaborating to ensure a steady supply of affordable drugs. The initiative has been successful in lowering production costs and drug prices, resulting in a significant decrease in the cost of HIV/AIDS medicine. The total number of patients benefiting from the initiative is 11.8 million, according to a spokesperson. Therefore, Clinton's claim that 9 million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine is true and even understates the actual number of beneficiaries.",1

Trump claimed that Clinton plans to massively increase admissions, including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees, without a screening plan. However, Clinton has stated that refugees would have to go through a rigorous vetting process before being admitted. The claim is mostly true but needs clarification.",1

He equated refugee admission to a bigger version of the Trojan Horse and criticized Hillary Clinton's plan to admit hundreds of thousands of refugees without an effective screening system. However, this claim is false. The vetting process for refugees has been in place since 1980 and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies, as well as the United Nations. It typically takes one to two years and includes numerous rounds of security checks. While there are concerns about information gaps, there is indeed a system to vet refugees from the Middle East.",1

The ad showed a photo of the reporter, Serge Kovaleski, who has a congenital condition that limits the movement of his joints, and a video clip of Trump at a rally appearing to physically mimic Kovaleski's disability.

"WHO: Hillary Clinton
CLAIM: Under Donald Trump's tax plan, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would receive more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined.
EXPLANATION: Clinton's claim is supported by a report from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which found that under Trump's plan, the highest-income households would receive the largest tax cuts, both in dollars and as a percentage of income. Specifically, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers, who earn over $3.7 million per year, would receive an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million in 2017. This group would receive 18 percent of the tax reduction, while the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would receive 16.4 percent of the reduction.",1

This claim was made to Donald Trump, who has refused to release his tax returns citing an IRS audit.

However, every Republican nominee since then has disclosed their tax returns.",1

However, it is important to note that estimating losses from intellectual property theft is difficult and subject to uncertainty. Therefore, the claim is rated as mostly true but requires clarification and additional information.",1

The Clinton campaign denied this claim, stating that Clinton has never advocated for repealing or abolishing the Second Amendment. However, gun rights advocates argue that Clinton's comments about stronger background checks and her disagreement with the Supreme Court's ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller suggest a desire to roll back the Second Amendment. Fact-checkers rate Trump's claim as false, as there is no direct evidence of Clinton wanting to abolish the Second Amendment.",1

However, election experts have stated that there is no increased risk of noncitizens voting in states with same-day registration compared to states that require voters to register in advance. Same-day registration states have safeguards in place, such as requiring proper identification and proof of residency, to ensure that only eligible citizens can vote. Therefore, Trump's claim is false.",1
"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on May 8, 2016, that the United States is the highest taxed nation in the world.

EXPLANATION: Trump's claim is false. When comparing the United States to other industrialized nations, data from 2014 shows that the United States is not the most highly taxed country. In terms of corporate tax rates, the United States does have one of the highest top marginal rates, but companies pay less in practice due to deductions and exclusions. When looking at the actual tax burden on U.S. companies, it is far from the highest in the world. Therefore, Trump's claim is inaccurate.",1

The money is primarily going to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which uses it for campaign infrastructure that benefits both Clinton and other Democratic candidates.

EXPLANATION: Trump's claim is based on a National Enquirer report that alleges Rafael Cruz is the man standing next to Oswald in a photo from 1963. However, technical experts have stated that the photo is too grainy to make a conclusive identification. Historians of the period also say there is no evidence to suggest that Cruz and Oswald had any association. Therefore, Trump's claim is considered implausible and ridiculous by experts, and it is rated as ""pants on fire"" by Politifact.",1

While it is true that neither Fidel Castro nor Raul Castro, the leaders of Cuba, were present at the airport, Trump's claim is not entirely accurate. The Cuban Foreign Minister and other high-ranking officials were there to greet President Obama. Additionally, there is a precedent for the foreign minister greeting a visiting president, as seen during President Nixon's trip to China in 1972. Therefore, the claim is rated as half true.",1

However, security experts and news reports strongly disagree with this claim. They acknowledge that ISIS has attacked Libya's oil fields to disrupt oil markets and prevent rival groups from profiting, but they assert that ISIS does not have the ability to control, refine, and sell the oil for millions of dollars a week. Experts argue that ISIS is primarily interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues. Therefore, the claim made by Trump is false.",1
"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed that he was ""totally against the war in Iraq"" and had been saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East.

EXPLANATION: The record shows that while Trump had some early reservations about the war, there is no evidence that he warned about regional destabilization before or after the war started. His opposition to the war evolved about a year after it began. Therefore, the claim that he was ""totally against the war in Iraq"" and had been warning about its destabilizing effects is false.",1

Factors such as registration barriers, voter ID laws, lack of time and resources, and a sense of inefficacy contribute to the lower voter turnout among the poor.

EXPLANATION: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania did lose nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2001, which corresponds to a 34% decrease. However, the claim about Harrisburg losing 40% of its manufacturing jobs is incorrect. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that Harrisburg actually experienced a decrease of 30% in manufacturing jobs. Overall, the claim is mostly true for Pennsylvania but inaccurate for Harrisburg.",1

Fact-checking revealed that while there were no direct questions about abortion, Clinton and Bernie Sanders both brought up the topic themselves in multiple debates. Therefore, the claim was rated as true.",1
"During the Brooklyn presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed that Republicans still want to privatize Social Security and turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street. However, this claim is exaggerated. While some Republicans, like Ted Cruz, have proposed a form of privatization involving personal accounts funded by a fraction of payroll taxes, none of the remaining GOP candidates have suggested turning over the trust fund to Wall Street. Clinton's statement takes a longstanding Democratic exaggeration about GOP overhaul proposals and makes it even further off-base.",1
"SEN. BERNIE SANDERS claimed to Meet the Press that Hillary Clinton supports a federal minimum wage of $12 an hour, while he supports a $15 minimum wage. Sanders is correct that Clinton's official position is to raise the federal minimum wage to $12, but she also supports the Fight for 15 campaign, which advocates for higher minimum wages in individual states and cities. Clinton has expressed support for raising the minimum wage to $15 in certain areas, such as Los Angeles and New York. Therefore, Sanders' claim is mostly true.",1
"In the April 15th, 2016 Democratic debate in New York, Hillary Clinton claimed that Bernie Sanders has been a reliable supporter of the NRA. While it is true that Sanders has voted against certain gun control measures, such as the Brady Bill, he has also voted in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, and expanding background checks. Sanders has received low marks from the NRA for the past 20 years and does not have full-throated support from the gun lobby. Therefore, Clinton's claim that Sanders has been a reliable supporter of the NRA is a stretch.",1
"During the Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders claimed that he remains one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. According to a study by Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, Sanders' net worth ranked in the bottom one-fifth of the 100-member chamber for the 2014 calendar year. However, it is important to note that the study is based on congressional financial disclosure forms, which provide only broad ranges of income and have certain exemptions. While the data is not precise, a credible calculation using these forms placed Sanders as having the 19th lowest net worth in the Senate. Therefore, the claim is rated as mostly true.",1

Sanders called for a nationwide ban on fracking, while Clinton supports it with conditions such as local choice, stronger environmental regulation, and disclosure of chemicals used.

However, the impact of these trade deals on job losses is still a matter of debate, with some studies showing significant job losses and others showing no significant impact.

EXPLANATION: In a blog post, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan stated that in-person voter fraud by impersonation is virtually nonexistent, with only 10 cases proven nationally out of 1 billion ballots cast since 2000. Donald Trump's claim contradicts this, suggesting that there is widespread voter fraud. However, Pocan's statement is supported by experts and data, as the number of documented cases of in-person voter fraud is extremely low compared to other occurrences, such as lightning strikes. Therefore, Trump's claim is not supported by evidence.",1

"On June 22nd, 2016, at Trump NY Soho, Donald Trump claimed that only about half of the emails sent or received by Hillary Clinton on her private email server have been released. He argued that Clinton and her staff determined which emails were work-related and which were personal, and the more than 30,000 emails deemed personal have not been available for public review. Trump rated Clinton's statement as half true, stating that it was partially accurate but taken out of context.",1
"Hillary Clinton claimed on Meet the Press that she is the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or on either side, who is being targeted by Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers in attack ads. However, this claim is inaccurate as data from the Center for Responsive Politics shows that the financial industry has contributed to both sides of the aisle, including to Clinton's own campaign. Groups backed by Wall Street have run attack ads against virtually every candidate, making Clinton's claim false.",1

Trump admitted that he had no proof that Cruz was behind the ad, but insisted that ""everybody knows he sent it out."" Fact-checking revealed that the ad was created by a super PAC called Make America Awesome, and there was no evidence of Cruz's involvement. Therefore, Trump's claim was rated as false.",1

EXPLANATION: Cruz was referring to an analysis by media firm MediaQuant, which tracks and assigns a dollar value to earned media coverage. According to MediaQuant, Trump received $1.898 billion worth of earned media coverage over the last 12 months, while Cruz received only $37.7 million. While Cruz's claim that he received ""almost none"" coverage is an exaggeration, the data does show a significant disparity in media coverage between Trump and Cruz.",1

However, experts have stated that Trump's claim is inaccurate. The money released under the deal was already Iran's frozen assets, and the actual amount is estimated to be closer to $100 billion. Additionally, in exchange for lifting the sanctions, the United States and its allies gained major restrictions on Iran's nuclear program and intrusive transparency. Therefore, Trump's claim that the United States received nothing in return is false.",1

"During the GOP debate in Miami on March 11th, 2016, Texas Senator Ted Cruz claimed that he has always opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). However, this claim is mostly true as Cruz initially supported granting the president the authority to finalize the TPP and spoke positively about the concept of the trade deal. It was only when the actual text of the treaty was released that Cruz opposed it. Therefore, while he did shift his stance on the TPP, he did not support it from the beginning.",1
"During the GOP debate in Miami, Senator Ted Cruz attacked Donald Trump for his stance on Israeli-Palestinian relations. Cruz claimed that Trump said he wanted to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians, but this doesn't capture the full spirit of Trump's comments.

However, fact-checking organizations found no evidence to support Clinton's claim. Sanders has actually advocated for a more ambitious plan and has supported the Clean Power Plan in both words and actions. Therefore, Clinton's claim was rated as false.",1
"During the Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Bernie Sanders claimed that the unemployment rate for Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school is 36%, while African American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51%. The most commonly used unemployment rate statistic does not show such high rates for each group, but research from the Economic Policy Institute supports Sanders' claim. However, the data is from March 2015 and the employment picture has generally been improving since then, so the rates may have decreased. Overall, Sanders' statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so it is rated mostly true.",1
"On March 9th, 2016, during the Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders claimed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, ""send them back"" in reference to undocumented immigrant children crossing the border. Sanders argued that he was a better friend to undocumented immigrants because he supported state driver's licenses for them in Vermont, while Clinton opposed it in New York. The Sanders campaign based their claim on an interview Clinton gave to CNN's Christiane Amanpour in June 2014. However, upon reviewing the full exchange, it was found that Clinton did not explicitly say ""send them back"" without any conditions. She stated that the government should first identify responsible adults to care for the children, but expressed a preference for as many as possible to be sent back. This statement is rated mostly true.",1
"During the Democratic debate in Miami on March 9th, 2016, Bernie Sanders claimed that Hillary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, to not allow driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. He stated that she said ""don't do it"" and New York State still does not provide driver's licenses to undocumented individuals. Sanders' claim is mostly true, as Clinton did oppose Spitzer's plan to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants during her first presidential race in 2007. However, it should be noted that during the 2016 campaign, Clinton changed her position and expressed support for state policies that provide driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.",1
"During a Democratic debate in Miami on March 9th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that her decision to use a private email server for State Department business was not unprecedented and that her predecessors had done the same thing. However, this claim is mostly false. While Colin Powell, a previous Secretary of State, did use a personal email address for government business, he did not use a private server like Clinton did. Additionally, most of Clinton's predecessors did not regularly use email at all. Therefore, Clinton's claim is misleading and not supported by the facts.",1

Kaine supported this claim by citing various studies and statistics that show higher arrest rates and longer sentences for African Americans compared to their white counterparts.

"During the GOP debate in Texas on February 25th, 2016, Florida Senator Marco Rubio claimed that Obamacare contained a bailout fund for insurance companies, which he and congressional Republicans got rid of. However, this claim is mostly false.

Rubio and Congress did limit one potential way the program could have been funded, but the program itself has not been wiped out. It will expire after 2016, and any outstanding bills will still need to be paid.",1

This claim is largely accurate as Clinton played a key role in creating the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides coverage for 8 million children. However, the ad fails to mention the contributions of others, so the claim is rated as mostly true.",1

"Jeb Bush claimed during a GOP debate in Greenville, South Carolina, that Donald Trump had made inappropriate comments about women, Senator John McCain, and a disabled reporter. Trump responded by accusing Bush of using foul language himself. Trump specifically mentioned a comment Bush made about mooning people, implying that it was not reported by the press. However, it was found that Bush's comment was made in jest during an interview with the Boston Globe and was actually reported by the publication. Therefore, Trump's claim was deemed mostly false.",1

"During the GOP debate in Greenville on February 13th, 2016, Ben Carson claimed that Joseph Stalin said, ""If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism, and our morality."" However, it is highly unlikely that Stalin ever spoke these words, as there is no evidence of this quote in history books, scholarly works, or primary sources. The quote is mostly found on social media with a picture of Stalin. Snopes, a fact-checking website, also concluded that it is dubious that Stalin would have made such a statement. Therefore, Carson's claim is considered false, and it is rated as ""pants on fire.""",1

"During the GOP debate in Greenville on February 13th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that he was the only one on the stage who said, ""Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq."" However, fact-checking reveals that there is no evidence of Trump publicly opposing the war before the invasion in March 2003. The only instance found was a vague comment expressing skepticism about the mission in Iraq. Therefore, Trump's claim that he loudly and clearly opposed the war is false.",1

Therefore, Clinton's claim is rated as half true.",1
"During the Democratic debate in Milwaukee on February 11th, 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders claimed that the African American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. This claim was supported by a 2013 report from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, which stated that African Americans had lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession. Pew Research Center data from 2011 also showed that the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from 2005 to 2009. Additionally, a 2014 Pew report revealed that the median net worth of black households decreased by 43 percent from 2007 to 2013. Census Bureau data further confirmed that black median net worth decreased by 61 percent from 2005 to 2009, while whites lost 21 percent of their wealth. Therefore, Sanders' claim was rated as true.",1
"On June 22nd, 2016, Donald Trump claimed at Trump NY Soho that Hillary Clinton's statement during the Democratic presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that ""Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years"" was incorrect.

Trump disagreed with Clinton's use of inflation-adjusted median household income as a measure of income growth, stating that it does not reflect the full picture.",1
"During the Democratic debate in Milwaukee, Senator Bernie Sanders claimed that in America, we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. This claim is supported by studies that show that brand-name drugs in the United States are consistently more expensive compared to other countries. The high prices in the US can be attributed to the fragmented healthcare system and the prohibition on Medicare from negotiating lower prices. While there are exceptions for generic drugs, overall, Sanders' statement is mostly true.",1
"On January 11th, 2017, during a press conference, Donald Trump claimed that the official unemployment rate of 4.9% to 5% is ""phony"" and that the real unemployment rate is as high as 42%. However, economists argue that the highest credible number they could calculate was 15.6%, which is still significantly lower than Trump's claim. They explain that the official unemployment rate does not include people who are not currently looking for work but may want to work in the future. Additionally, Trump's claim is based on a flawed calculation that includes people who have valid reasons for not working, such as students, retirees, and those with disabilities. Therefore, the claim is rated as ""pants on fire"" false.",1

Additionally, most of Trump's contributions have been in the form of loans, which he may expect to be paid back.

"CLAIM: During a Democratic debate in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton claimed that Bernie Sanders suggested that Iranian troops should fight on the ground in Syria, putting them on the doorstep of Israel.

EXPLANATION: Clinton pointed out that a group of national security experts expressed concerns about Sanders' views on foreign policy and national security, specifically mentioning his suggestion of involving Iranian troops in Syria. Sanders did advocate for a multinational Muslim coalition, which included nations like Iran, to fight against ISIS in Syria. However, it is important to note that Sanders' proposal did not specifically mention Iranian troops being stationed on the Israeli border, and the coalition also included nations friendly towards Israel. Therefore, while Clinton's claim is mostly true, it lacks some important details.",1
Bernie Sanders mistaken about whether his campaign's ad had cited a nonexistent endorsemen,0
"During the Democratic presidential debate on February 4th, 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders claimed that Americans are working longer hours for low wages and that almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. While it is true that wages have been flat since the 1970s and there is mixed evidence regarding longer working hours, it is not accurate to say that almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. The economist Sanders relies on estimated that the top 1 percent had accumulated 91 percent of the income gains made from 2009 to 2012, but this estimate dropped to 58 percent in an updated analysis. Therefore, while a disproportionate amount of income and wealth is going to the very richest Americans, Sanders is overexaggerating by claiming that almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.",1

"During the presidential debate on September 26th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that China has ""total control, just about"" over North Korea. While China does have influence over North Korea due to its role in trade, experts argue that China does not have total control. China's leverage over North Korea comes from its economic relationship, as it provides a significant portion of North Korea's trade and investment flows. However, North Korea's government has shown a willingness to act independently, as seen in its recent nuclear test despite China's objections. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false as it overlooks the limits to China's influence over North Korea.",1

"During the Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina, Bernie Sanders claimed that less than 10 percent of the defense budget goes towards fighting ISIS and international terrorism. However, experts argue that Sanders is using a narrow view of the defense budget and not considering the true fungibility of the funds. They explain that the defense budget is not easily separated into specific allocations for different purposes, and that resources paid for in the base budget are used for operations against ISIS and other terrorist threats. Therefore, Sanders' claim is mostly false.",1
"During a healthcare debate between Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz on February 7th, 2017, Cruz claimed that Sanders was not an integral player in the crafting of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Cruz argued that while Sanders did contribute to the final legislation by securing $11 billion in funding for community health centers, he was not involved in the core elements of the law such as the exchanges, subsidies, mandates, and cost containment provisions. Cruz concluded that Sanders' claim of helping to write the ACA was mostly false.",1
"During the January 17th Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, Hillary Clinton claimed that healthcare costs are the lowest they've been in 50 years. However, fact-checking organizations found that Clinton's claim was false.

The Clinton campaign acknowledged that she misspoke, and the claim was rated as false.",1

"During the Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina, on January 17th, 2016, Hillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders for his position on guns. She claimed that Sanders voted for what they call the ""Charleston loophole."" This refers to the three-day time limit for background checks on gun purchases, which allowed Dylann Roof to obtain a gun and later commit the Charleston church shooting. Sanders voted in 1993 to shorten the time window for the government to conduct background checks, which critics argue contributed to the loophole. The fact-check rates Clinton's claim as mostly true.",1
"During the Democratic debate in Charleston, Hillary Clinton claimed that Bernie Sanders had flip-flopped on his position regarding immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers. Clinton's statement is accurate, as Sanders had previously defended his vote on a 2005 bill that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers, but later expressed support for a proposal to rescind the immunity provisions. This change in position can be considered a flip-flop.",1

"During the GOP debate in Charleston on January 15th, 2016, Marco Rubio accused Ted Cruz of flip-flopping on his stance on birthright citizenship. Rubio claimed that Cruz used to be in favor of birthright citizenship but is now against it. Rubio based his accusation on a 2011 radio interview where Cruz stated that birthright citizenship was guaranteed by the 14th amendment and that conservatives should focus on border security instead of trying to change the constitution. However, Cruz has since insisted that he opposed birthright citizenship then and opposes it now. While Cruz has expressed support for pursuing a change in the policy, either through an amendment or legislation, there is no evidence to contradict his current stance. Therefore, Rubio's statement is rated as mostly false.",1
"During the GOP debate in Charleston, Senator Ted Cruz claimed that Senator Marco Rubio's attacks on his record on military spending were false. Cruz specifically mentioned Rubio's claim that the only budget he had ever voted for was one that cut defense spending. Cruz countered by stating that he had actually voted for Rubio's amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. This claim by Cruz is true, as he did vote for Rubio's amendment, which aimed to raise projected defense spending outlays through 2022.",1
"During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, SC, Senator Ted Cruz claimed that President Obama appointed Eric Holder as Attorney General and that Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. Cruz's claim is supported by a speech given by Holder in 1995, where he discussed changing the way people think about guns, especially young people, in order to reduce gun violence in Washington, D.C. However, Cruz leaves out important context, such as the fact that the remark was made 14 years before Holder became Attorney General and that it was targeted towards youth during a high-crime era in Washington, D.C. Therefore, the claim is rated as half true.",1
"During the GOP debate in Charleston on January 14th, 2016, Marco Rubio claimed that Chris Christie supported the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Rubio stated that Christie endorsed many ideas supported by President Obama, including common core, gun control, and the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Christie denied supporting Sotomayor during the debate, but evidence shows that he did express some support for her confirmation two months after initially stating she would not have been his choice. Therefore, Rubio's claim that Christie supported Sotomayor is false.",1
"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush claimed at a GOP debate in South Carolina on January 14th, 2016, that Hillary Clinton is under investigation with the FBI. However, this claim is not entirely accurate. While there is an FBI inquiry into the security of Clinton's private email server, Clinton herself is not the target of the investigation, and it is not a criminal investigation. Therefore, Bush's statement is rated as half true.",1
"During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, SC, on January 15th, 2016, Senator Ted Cruz claimed that the United States has the lowest percentage of Americans working today since 1977. This claim is mostly true, as one key employment statistic, the civilian labor force participation rate, is at its lowest level since the 1970s. However, there are two important factors to consider. First, the aging of the baby boom generation has contributed to the decline in the labor force participation rate. Second, if we look at a different statistic, the employment-population ratio, Cruz's statement is incorrect. This ratio has actually been improving in recent years, although it is still below its pre-recession highs. Overall, while Cruz's wording was sloppy, his claim highlights a concerning trend in the economy, but it is important to consider demographic factors beyond the control of any president.",1
"On January 15th, 2016, during the GOP debate in Charleston, Donald Trump claimed that there were very few women and children among Syrian refugees and migrants entering Europe. He argued that the majority were strong, powerful men. However, data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees contradicts Trump's claim. According to the data, over 50% of Syrian refugees are female, and over 51% are children aged 17 or younger. Additionally, among migrants arriving by sea, 31% are children and 19% are women. Therefore, Trump's statement is false.",1
"During his 2016 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama claimed that the United States currently has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. This claim was supported by evidence such as the United States being the world's largest economy at current market exchange rates and having a cumulative GDP growth of 9.7% since the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, the United States has added as many jobs as all other advanced economies combined since 2010. Experts agreed that while the claim is difficult to assess, when comparing the United States to other advanced economies, it can be argued that the United States is in a strong position economically.",1

However, this claim is mostly false. South Korea does pay for the U.S. presence, with payments totaling over $800 million annually. Additionally, the United States benefits strategically from the military investment in South Korea. The presence of U.S. forces helps deter conflict, stabilize the region, and project military power throughout the western Pacific.

While it may be used as a supporting argument or a wedge issue in recruitment, other grievances against the United States, such as military airstrikes, are more important in terms of propaganda.

"During the GOP debate in Charleston on January 15th, 2016, Marco Rubio claimed that Ted Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposed. Rubio's campaign pointed to Cruz's 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by Rand Paul, which included an increase in defense spending each year but did not keep pace with estimated projections. Experts argued that while Paul's proposal was below Obama's request, it cannot be considered a cut. Therefore, Rubio's claim was rated as mostly false.",1

However, the 9/11 Commission report found that only two of the hijackers were married, one had a girlfriend, and none of these women were in the United States before the attacks. The Commission also found evidence that the hijackers had cut ties with their families, contradicting Trump's claim. Therefore, this claim is false.",1

However, this claim is false and misleading. The image he tweeted contained racially loaded and incorrect murder statistics, with none of the numbers supported by official sources. The figures on black-on-white homicides and white-on-white homicides are wildly inaccurate, and the crime statistics bureau cited in the image does not exist. The most glaring inaccuracies are regarding white homicide victims, as whites tend to kill other whites by overwhelming percentages. Additionally, the statistics on police-related deaths are also incorrect, as official counts miss a significant portion of these deaths. Overall, Trump's claim is rated as ""pants on fire"" by Politifact.",1

The only mentions found were uncorroborated and unsourced rumors, which were either debunked or unproven. Therefore, Scherer rates Trump's statement as ""pants on fire.""",1

"During the GOP debate in Milwaukee on November 10th, 2015, Donald Trump claimed that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was designed for China to come in through the back door and take advantage of everyone. However, experts have pointed out that China is not a part of the TPP and that the trade deal is more likely to negatively impact China. While there is a possibility that China could benefit from increased trading between TPP member countries, this would be offset by the greater level of economic activity in those countries. Experts also noted that China would need to meet the requirements of the agreement before being able to join, which is not expected to happen anytime soon. Overall, Trump's claim that the TPP was designed for China's benefit is false.",1

Experts argue that while there may be winners and losers, it is inaccurate to say that no one has benefited from Obamacare.",1
"During the GOP debate in Milwaukee on November 10th, 2015, Donald Trump claimed that President Eisenhower moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of the country. Trump was referring to a campaign called ""Operation Wetback"" in 1954. While historians do not dispute that the operation resulted in deportations, the number of 1.5 million is considered an exaggeration. Estimates range from 250,000 to 1.3 million, with the most widely accepted number being around 250,000. Additionally, the campaign also included more legal immigration opportunities, making it more than just a deportation program. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as half true.",1
"During the GOP debate in Milwaukee on November 10th, 2015, Ben Carson was asked if he was worried that his campaign was being hurt by questions about his biography.

PolitiFact fact-checked Carson's claim that Clinton told her daughter and a government official that Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and then told everybody else that it was a video. They found that Carson was oversimplifying and distorting Clinton's comments, and rated his statement as mostly false. While Clinton did privately tell her daughter and the Libyan president that terrorists were responsible for the attack, she did not tell everybody else that it was a video. In fact, she made various statements that were more measured and did not directly blame the video for the attacks.",1

On the other hand, estimates put the Bible at approximately 800,000 words. Therefore, Cruz's claim that the tax code is roughly five times as long as the Bible is true.",1
"During the fourth Republican presidential debate in November 2015, Senator Rand Paul claimed that income inequality is worst in cities run by Democrats. This claim was fact-checked and found to be partially accurate. A study by the Brookings Institution showed that of the 10 most unequal cities, nine had Democratic mayors. However, experts caution that attributing inequality solely to mayoral policies is not reasonable, as many factors contribute to a city's economic success. Additionally, the size and population of cities play a significant role in income inequality. The claim is partially accurate but overlooks important details, so it is rated as half true.",1

When looking at GDP growth, Trump is correct that the current recovery is the slowest since the Great Depression. However, when considering the employment picture, the recovery following the 2001 recession was worse. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as half true.",1

"During the GOP debate in Boulder, Colorado on October 28th, 2015, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz claimed that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. However, this claim is false. According to the Census Bureau, the median wage for women actually increased from $28,574 in 2008 to $29,098 in 2014. Cruz's spokesperson confirmed that Cruz intended to refer to income rather than wages, and by this measure, the figure for women did decline from $22,945 in 2008 to $22,240 in 2014. However, the income statistic includes a much larger mix of income flows and applies to all women over the age of 15, not just those in paid work. Therefore, Cruz's statement is inaccurate and has been rated as false by Politifact.",1
"Carly Fiorina claimed during the GOP debate in Boulder on October 28th, 2015 that it is hypocritical for Hillary Clinton to talk about being the first woman president when her policies, along with those of President Obama, have been detrimental to women.

While there was a decrease in employment for women between January 2009 and March 2012, by January 2013, the number of women with jobs had actually increased by 416,000. Therefore, Fiorina's claim is not supported by the data.",1

However, Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 percent tax rate for billionaires or for the average American. While Sanders has advocated for increasing taxes on the wealthiest individuals and corporations, his tax proposals do not envision raising taxes for ordinary Americans to anywhere near 90 percent.

While it is true that some insurance plans in the federal exchange will see price hikes at these levels, Trump is cherry-picking the high end of premium changes. Estimates for the national average range from 4.4 percent to 13 percent, making Trump's claim partially accurate but taken out of context.",1

Clinton's Wall Street reform plan does not include reinstating Glass-Steagall, and she has expressed skepticism that it would solve the problems stemming from financial regulation. However, Clinton argues that her alternative approach, including imposing a risk fee on financial institutions and regulations on the shadow banking sector, would be more comprehensive and effective. Therefore, O'Malley's claim is mostly true but needs additional context.",1
"On July 13th, 2017, during an interview with Trump Roberston, Donald Trump claimed that the Clean Water Act allows the government to regulate bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle. However, this claim is mostly false. The Clean Water Act does seek to clarify what types of bodies of water the EPA can oversee, but it explicitly excludes puddles, along with most ditches and ornamental bodies of water. The key factor for determining Clean Water Act jurisdiction is how connected a body of water is, not its size. Therefore, small isolated puddles or bodies of water that do not connect to larger ecosystems should not be subject to regulation under the new rule.",1

"During the first Democratic debate on October 13th, 2015, Bernie Sanders claimed that the United States is imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. However, data shows that being sentenced to prison for marijuana possession alone is exceedingly rare. While high levels of arrests for marijuana possession do occur, getting a prison sentence for just smoking marijuana is extremely unusual. Therefore, Sanders' claim is mostly false.",1
"During the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on October 13th, 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed that Edward Snowden could have received whistleblower protections if he had raised his concerns through proper channels. However, experts argue that the 1998 law Clinton referenced does not provide strong protections for national security whistleblowers, and it is unclear if Snowden's concerns would have fallen under the guidelines of that law. Additionally, the law does not protect whistleblowers from reprisals, and there is a significant legal debate over whether Snowden's actions would have been protected. Therefore, Clinton's claim is mostly false.",1
"During the first Democratic presidential debate on October 13th, 2015, Bernie Sanders claimed that every other major country has family paid leave. He argued that the United States lags behind other countries in providing paid leave for new mothers. Sanders backed up his claim with data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Labor Organization (ILO), which both found that the United States is the only country to offer no statutory entitlement to paid leave on a national basis. While there are some exclusions for certain workers in other countries, Sanders' claim is mostly true.",1
"During the Democratic presidential debate on October 13th, 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed that she never took a position on the Keystone XL oil pipeline until she announced her opposition to it in September 2015. Critics pointed to a statement she made in 2010 where she indicated that the administration was inclined to approve the pipeline. However, Clinton argued that her 2010 statement was qualified by the fact that the analysis was not complete and the administration had not taken a final position. Therefore, she maintained that her position on Keystone XL was not a flip-flop.",1

"During the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on October 13th, 2015, Bernie Sanders claimed that the United States has more people in jail than any other country. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2013 there were over 2.2 million people in local jails, state, and federal prisons in the United States. The Institute for Criminal Policy Research at the University of London reports that China has about 1.65 million prisoners, placing it second behind the United States. However, the Chinese figure does not include many thousands of people in detention centers. Adjusted for population, the United States has a higher incarceration rate than any other nation. Therefore, Sanders' claim is mostly true.",1
"During the second presidential debate on October 10th, 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton had previously called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal the ""gold standard."" This claim was made in response to Clinton's defense of her opposition to the TPP during the debate. Trump argued that Clinton's previous support for the deal contradicted her current stance.",1
"During the first Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas on October 13th, 2015, Bernie Sanders claimed that African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent and Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. However, the official unemployment rates for African-American and Hispanic youth are actually 31.5 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively. While these rates are still disproportionately high, they are not as high as Sanders stated. Therefore, his claim is rated as half true and in need of clarification.",1
"During the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas on October 13th, 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed that Bernie Sanders had voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated a five-day waiting period for background checks for gun purchases. Clinton's claim is true, as Sanders did vote against the bill five times from 1991 to 1993. Sanders' campaign manager stated that he voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents in Vermont, a rural state with high gun ownership. Overall, Sanders has a mixed record on gun control, but Clinton's claim about his votes on the Brady Bill is accurate.",1

"In a debate on October 13th, 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. This is a change from her previous support of the deal while serving as Secretary of State. Clinton stated that she does not believe the agreement meets the high standards she has set. Some speculate that her change in stance is a political move to appeal to liberals who oppose the deal. However, it is also possible that the deal has changed significantly since Clinton's time in the Obama administration, as the negotiations have been conducted in secret. Clinton still believes in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement, but does not believe the TPP has met that standard.",1

In comparison, the New America Foundation reported that there were 71 deaths from domestic acts of terrorism on U.S. soil during the same time period. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly true.",1

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, out of the 4 million registered Syrian refugees, 50.3% are female and 51.1% are children. Trump's statement is based on a confusion between two different sets of refugees - those reaching Europe by sea, who are mostly men, and the registered refugees in UN camps, who are predominantly women and children. Only about 10,000 refugees from the camps are slated for resettlement in the United States, and they undergo extensive background screenings, making it unlikely that they would be ISIS operatives.",1

"During a press conference on January 11th, 2017, Donald Trump claimed that the official unemployment rate of 5.1 percent is a ""joke"" and that the real unemployment rate is as high as 42 percent. Trump based this claim on a column by David Stockman, who calculated the rate by dividing the actual number of working hours by the potential working hours. However, economists argue that this calculation is flawed as it does not consider valid reasons for not working, such as being a student, a stay-at-home parent, or having a disability. The Bureau of Labor Statistics offers a more expansive alternative measurement called the U6 rate, which currently stands at 10.3 percent. After considering various factors, the highest unemployment rate that could be calculated was 16.4 percent, which is still significantly lower than Trump's claim of 42 percent. Therefore, Trump's claim is rated as ""pants on fire"" false.",1

"During the Sanders Cruz healthcare debate on February 7th, 2017, Bernie Sanders claimed that the United States spends almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other country. However, this claim is false. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) shows that while the United States does spend more on healthcare per capita than other countries, it is not always twice as much. Sanders' statement suggests a larger gap between the United States and other countries than actually exists.",1

"CLAIM: During the third presidential debate on October 19th, 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump has changed his stance on abortion.

Clinton stated that Trump's credentials on the issue of abortion are the most spotty among all the leading Republican candidates. She pointed out that Trump has changed his mind on amnesty, healthcare, and abortion, and questioned what principles he would govern by. Clinton cited evidence from articles in The Washington Post and National Journal that documented Trump's shift from being pro-choice to pro-life. She concluded that Trump's own admission confirms that he changed his mind on abortion, making her claim true.",1

EXPLANATION: This claim was made during a debate on immigration in Phoenix. The claim is based on a widely cited statistic that originated from a 2006 report by the Pew Research Center. The report estimated that nearly half of all unauthorized migrants in the US entered the country legally through a port of entry. However, there has been no updated data since then, making it difficult to provide a more current figure. Experts agree that while immigration trends have changed, the 40 percent estimate can still be considered acceptable. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly true.",1

While Sanders' terminology was not entirely accurate, economists agree that his general point about the employment prospects for African American youth is correct.

"During the vice presidential debate on October 5th, 2016, Mike Pence claimed that only 15% of the money donated to the Clinton Foundation went to actual charitable causes, while the rest went to travel, salaries, and benefits. This claim was based on a report in the conservative publication, The Federalist. The Clinton Foundation responded by stating that over 88% of their expenditures go directly to their charitable work. The Foundation's unique model, where they keep their money in-house and hire staff to carry out their own humanitarian programs, makes their finances more complicated than other foundations. The Foundation combines the finances of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which was split off from the Foundation in 2010, to calculate their numbers. The Foundation argues that their employees are doing the charitable work directly, rather than outsourcing it to other organizations. The claim made by Pence contains some truth, as a large portion of the Foundation's spending does go towards items other than charitable grants. However, it ignores the fact that the Foundation does carry out its own charitable work and does not spend zero dollars beyond grants on charitable activities. Therefore, the claim is rated as mostly false.",1

Trump was referencing the book ""Clinton Cash"" by Peter Schweizer, which suggests a troubling trend of foreign interests currying favor with Hillary Clinton through large speaking fees paid to her husband.

Cruz cited a 2010 University of Virginia study that looked at Medicaid patients who underwent surgery. However, experts argue that this statistic is misleading because Medicaid patients are generally sicker and tend to wait until the last minute for care. Other studies have shown that Medicaid improves access and quality of life for many patients, or at the very least, does not harm them. Therefore, Cruz's claim is rated as mostly false.",1

"CLAIM: During the 2016 presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that the Clinton Foundation took millions of dollars from foreign governments, including up to $5 million from the United Arab Emirates and up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia.

EXPLANATION: The Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit philanthropy founded by former President Bill Clinton, has indeed received large sums of money from foreign governments. According to information from the Clinton Foundation website, six foreign governments, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, have donated between $1 million and $25 million to the foundation. These donations were made after Hillary Clinton left the State Department and officially joined the foundation. While it is not illegal for a nonprofit to accept donations from foreign governments, it has raised ethical concerns due to Clinton's political positions.",1

CLAIM: Booker claimed that there are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation, or parole than were enslaved in 1850.
EXPLANATION: During a Democratic debate on September 12th, 2019, Booker made the claim that there are currently more African American men under some form of judicial system supervision than there were African American men enslaved in 1850. Research conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Criminal Statistics and The Sentencing Project supports Booker's claim, with estimates ranging from 1.68 million to 1.88 million African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013. This number is significantly higher than the estimated number of African American men enslaved in 1850, which was 872,924. Therefore, Booker's claim is rated as true.",1

EXPLANATION: McConnell's claim is an exaggeration. While the agreement is not binding and China may have already planned to make these emissions cuts, experts say it would be less risky for China's economy to work towards the goal over the next 16 years rather than doing it overnight. Additionally, China's pledge to increase non-fossil fuel use to 20% of its energy mix cannot be achieved overnight and will take years to carry out. Therefore, Trump's claim is mostly false.",1
Study correct on Georgia's gender-based murder rate | PolitiFact Georg,0
"During a healthcare debate between Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz, conservative talk show host Dana Loesch claimed that 4.7 million people have lost their insurance due to Obamacare. This claim matches a list compiled by the Associated Press in December 2013, which calculated a low-end figure of how many Americans received insurance cancellation notifications. However, it is important to note that not every state was able to provide a figure, hence Loesch isolating on 32 states. Additionally, there are reasons to doubt the accuracy of the numbers in certain states, as reported by Politifact. While the Affordable Care Act's standards played a role in some people losing coverage, it is also important to consider that people often change, drop, or alter coverage in the individual market regardless of the ACA. Furthermore, the claim made by Loesch fails to acknowledge that some people were able to find replacement coverage. A study published by RAND in April 2014 estimated that fewer than 1 million people ended up without any coverage at all, with over half of the original group buying another policy in the individual market. Overall, while the ACA did have an impact on some people losing coverage, the net impact has been a boost in the number of insured individuals. Therefore, Loesch's claim is mostly false.",1

Obama argued that Romney's plan would have let General Motors and Chrysler fend for themselves. Romney countered by saying that he would provide guarantees to the companies, allowing them to go through bankruptcy and come out of it successfully. Fact-checkers found that Romney's statement was vague and could be interpreted in different ways, but Obama's claim was mostly false because Romney did mention a government guarantee, which could apply to loans during or after bankruptcy.",1

"During the third presidential debate in October 2012, President Obama claimed that veteran unemployment is now lower than the general population. He mentioned his efforts to put veterans back to work by rebuilding infrastructure and improving access to healthcare and certifications. Fact-checking data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it was found that while veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when Obama took office, it has since decreased. However, when looking specifically at post-9/11 veterans, the unemployment rate is higher than the general population. Therefore, Obama's claim is rated as half true.",1
"During the third presidential debate in 2012, Mitt Romney claimed that he balanced the budget of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. This claim is accurate in terms of the budget for the Olympic operations, as Romney's stewardship resulted in a surplus of about $100 million. However, it is important to note that there was a separate budget for government funding, which Romney helped secure, ranging from $400 million to possibly $1.5 billion. This additional funding is not included in the balance sheet Romney is referring to. Therefore, while the claim is mostly true, it requires clarification and additional information.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 23rd, 2012, Mitt Romney claimed that President Barack Obama said he was going to create daylight between the United States and Israel. This claim was based on a Washington Post article from July 15, 2012, which reported on a meeting Obama had with Jewish leaders in 2009. While there is no transcript of the meeting, the article stated that Obama disagreed with the idea of no space between the US and Israel, as it eroded credibility with Arab states. The White House did not confirm or deny Obama's statement, but pointed to examples of his support for Israel, such as multiple meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and increased funding for Israel's missile defense system. Some experts agreed with Romney's characterization, stating that Obama has worked to put daylight between the US and Israel, while others argued that the goal was to be open about policy disagreements rather than create distance. Overall, Romney's claim was rated mostly true.",1
"During the third presidential debate on October 23rd, 2012, President Obama claimed that Mitt Romney called Russia America's number one geopolitical threat. However, fact-checking revealed that Romney had actually referred to Russia as America's number one geopolitical foe, not threat. Romney had made this distinction in previous interviews, stating that while Russia is a geopolitical adversary, Iran poses the greatest national security threat due to its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Therefore, Obama's claim was rated as half true.",1

"In the third presidential debate on October 23rd, 2012, President Obama claimed that Republican nominee Mitt Romney planned to increase defense spending by $2 trillion, which the military did not ask for. Fact-checking organizations found that Romney's plan did indeed call for an increase in defense spending by $2 trillion over the next ten years, as outlined on his campaign website. While there may be some flexibility in achieving this goal, military leaders have testified in support of President Obama's defense spending plan, indicating no evidence of disagreement behind the scenes. Therefore, the claim made by President Obama was rated as true.",1

Romney's campaign ad states that under Obama, families have lost over $4,000 a year in income and the national debt is now $16 trillion and growing. The ad cites an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, which refers to data from a private group called Sentier Research. Sentier's data shows that median household income dropped by almost $4,000 from January 2009 to June 2012. However, it is important to note that attributing outcomes solely to presidents is problematic, as there are many factors beyond their control. The ad oversimplifies the issue by solely blaming Obama for the decline in income. Therefore, the claim is rated as half true.",1

"During the third presidential debate on October 23rd, 2012, President Obama claimed that Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries. Fact-checkers confirmed that some of the companies associated with Romney and Bain Capital did engage in outsourcing, but they were not pioneers in the practice. Outsourcing had been a common strategy for many companies since the early 1990s, and Bain was just one of many private equity firms participating in this trend. While Romney was not personally involved in managing these firms after 1999, he was the founder of Bain and had assembled a team that sought high returns, including through investments in companies involved in outsourcing. Therefore, the claim that these were ""Romney's companies"" is reasonable, but the assertion that they were pioneers in outsourcing is an exaggeration.",1

"CLAIM: Donald Trump claimed during a media tour on ABC's The View on March 23, 2011, that South Korea does not pay the United States for military support and that they make hundreds of billions of dollars in profit from the US. He also stated that there are 25,000 soldiers stationed in South Korea. 

EXPLANATION: Trump's claim that South Korea does not pay the US for military support is false. South Korea regularly signs agreements to reimburse the US for the presence of troops, with payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars annually. While some have questioned whether South Korea pays enough, it is incorrect to suggest that they bear no financial burden. Additionally, Trump's estimate of 25,000 soldiers is close to the actual number of US service members stationed in South Korea, which is approximately 28,500.",1
